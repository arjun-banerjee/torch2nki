=== Iteration 2 ===
The error "AssertionError: Insufficient rank!" occurs because the `nl.zeros(size, dtype=v1.dtype)` line is attempting to create a tensor with a single integer value for `size`, which is not in the expected tuple format for the shape of the tensor. The `nl.zeros` function expects a shape parameter that is a tuple, even if it is just a single dimension. Therefore, I will modify this line to pass in the shape as a tuple `(size,)` instead of just `size`.

=== Iteration 3 ===
The error message "AssertionError: Insufficient rank!" indicates that the kernel is trying to create a tensor using `nl.zeros` with an incorrect shape argument. Specifically, the shape provided to `nl.zeros` must be a tuple, but the implementation is passing an integer. This results in the kernel failing because it expects a higher dimensionality.

=== Iteration 4 ===
The error I encountered is due to the line `result = nl.zeros(size, dtype=v1.dtype)`. The `nl.zeros` function expects the `shape` parameter to be a tuple, but I provided an integer (size). This results in an "Insufficient rank!" assertion error. To resolve this, I need to ensure that I pass a tuple representing the shape to the `nl.zeros` function. Furthermore, I will also ensure the kernel is structured properly to follow best practices and utilize efficient NKI API calls.

=== Iteration 5 ===
The error message "AssertionError: Insufficient rank!" indicates that the `nl.zeros` function is expecting a shape with a certain rank (typically a tuple), but it is receiving an integer instead. The line `result = nl.zeros(size, dtype=v1.dtype)` is meant to create a tensor of zeros with the shape of the input vectors. Since `size` is an integer, I need to convert it into a tuple format by wrapping it in parentheses, like `result = nl.zeros((size,), dtype=v1.dtype)`. This should resolve the rank issue.
