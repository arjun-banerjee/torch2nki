FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Store into a tensor on device memory (HBM) from on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.
value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
none

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM

    # and their shapes are compatible for addition
    vector_shape = (128, 512)  # Example shape
    vector_addition_kernel(a_tensor, b_tensor, c_tensor, vector_shape)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Imports**: The necessary modules from `neuronxcc` are imported for NKI operations.
- **Function Definition**: 
  - `vector_addition_kernel` is defined to encapsulate the logic for vector addition.
  - It takes input tensors `a_tensor` and `b_tensor`, as well as an output tensor `c_tensor`, along with their shape.
- **Assertions**: An assertion checks that the vector shape is two-dimensional to ensure valid operations.
- **Batch Processing**: The addition is performed in batches using a loop that iterates over the first dimension of the vector:
  - **Loading Tensors**: The input tensors are loaded from HBM into on-chip memory (SBUF).
  - **Element-wise Addition**: The `nl.add` operation performs the addition on the loaded tiles.
  - **Storing Result**: The result is stored back into HBM using `nl.store`.
- **Example Usage**: A placeholder for how the tensors might be used in an actual application is provided.

### Best Practices Followed:
- **Modularity**: The function is defined separately to allow for easy reuse and testing.
- **Assertions**: Basic input validation is done using assertions to catch potential issues early.
- **Batch Processing**: The implementation processes data in batches to conform with NKI's memory management practices.

This kernel is ready for integration into a larger system or for further optimization based on specific hardware characteristics and performance requirements.

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Store into a tensor on device memory (HBM) from on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.
value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-21 19:00:30] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 1:
*** The error message indicates that the `torch` module is not found, which suggests that the environment in which the kernel is being executed is missing the PyTorch library. Since the kernel itself doesn't directly reference or require PyTorch, this error is likely due to an issue in the setup or the environment where the kernel is being executed. The missing `torch` module is not directly related to the kernel code provided, but it suggests that there might be a testing or execution script that relies on PyTorch being installed. ***

*** To resolve this issue, I will ensure that the appropriate environment is set up with PyTorch installed. If the intention is to run tests or additional scripts that depend on PyTorch, I will need to install it using a package manager like `pip`. For instance, I can run `pip install torch` in the terminal. Once I confirm that PyTorch is installed, I will re-run the kernel to determine if the original issue persists. ***

*** Additionally, I will verify the kernel code for any possible improvements or errors, ensuring that it correctly implements the vector addition functionality without any issues. However, since the kernel seems well-structured for the task at hand, I will focus on the environment setup first. ***

### Steps to Fix:
1. Install PyTorch:
   - Open the terminal and run the command:
     ```bash
     pip install torch
     ```
2. After installation, re-run the kernel code to check if any further issues arise.

3. If the kernel runs successfully, I will check the output to ensure it meets the expected results. If there are further issues, I will analyze them based on the specific error messages encountered. 

By following these steps, I can address the immediate problem of the missing `torch` module and ensure the kernel runs correctly.

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
