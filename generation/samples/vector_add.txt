The error message indicates that there is an attempt to import the `torch` library, but it is not installed in the environment where the script is being executed.

*** My initial reasoning is that the error occurs because the script `test_vector_add.py` is trying to import `torch`, which is not a part of the provided kernel code. This suggests that there might be an additional file or script that relies on PyTorch, and it is failing due to the absence of this library. Since my kernel does not use `torch`, this indicates that the issue is external to my kernel implementation. ***

To resolve this issue, I would take the following steps:

1. **Check the Environment**: Ensure that the environment where the script is being run has the required libraries installed. In this case, the `torch` library should be installed. This can typically be done via pip:
   ```
   pip install torch
   ```
   
2. **Review Dependencies**: Review the `test_vector_add.py` script or any other scripts that are executed alongside to see if they mistakenly require `torch`. If they do not need it, I could remove or comment out the import statement.

3. **Isolate the Kernel**: If the kernel is intended to be run independently, I could provide a standalone test or example usage that does not rely on external libraries like `torch`. This would allow users to test the kernel without encountering such errors.

4. **Documentation**: Update the documentation or comments in the kernel to clarify that it does not depend on `torch`, to prevent confusion in the future.

After implementing these steps, if the environment is set up correctly and no unnecessary dependencies are included, the kernel should run without encountering the `ModuleNotFoundError`.
