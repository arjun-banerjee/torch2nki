***The error message indicates that the Python interpreter is unable to find the 'torch' module. This implies that the code is either depending on a library that requires PyTorch as a prerequisite or is being run in an environment where PyTorch is not installed. Since the provided kernel does not explicitly use PyTorch, it's possible that the surrounding code or test framework is trying to import it, leading to this error. To fix this issue, I will check if PyTorch is necessary for this code to run. If it is not required, I will remove the import. If it is required, I will provide instructions for installing it.***

### Possible Solutions

1. **Check for Dependency**: First, I will investigate whether 'torch' is indeed required for my kernel. If the kernel is standalone and does not utilize any features from the 'torch' library explicitly, then I can proceed to remove the import.

2. **Remove PyTorch Dependency**: If I find that 'torch' is not a needed dependency for the kernel and the import is extraneous, I will remove the line that tries to import it.

3. **Install PyTorch**: If the surrounding code or test framework genuinely requires PyTorch, then I will provide instructions on how to install it using `pip` or `conda`. 

### Implementation

Assuming that the import statement for `torch` is not necessary for the kernel to function, I will propose a modification to the code:

```python
import neuronxcc as nki

# Define the kernel for vector addition
@nki.kernel
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2, result):
    """
    Kernel to add two vectors element-wise.
    
    :param v1: Input vector 1 (tile)
    :param v2: Input vector 2 (tile)
    :param result: Output vector (tile)
    """
    # Define the range for the vector elements
    for i in nki.language.affine_range(v1.shape[0]):
        result[i] = v1[i] + v2[i]

def vector_add(v1, v2):
    """
    Wrapper function to perform vector addition using the NKI kernel.

    :param v1: List of numbers (first vector)
    :param v2: List of numbers (second vector)
    :return: List representing the sum of the two vectors
    """
    if len(v1) != len(v2):
        raise ValueError("Vectors must be of the same length")

    # Convert input lists to NKI tiles
    tile_v1 = nki.make_tile(v1)
    tile_v2 = nki.make_tile(v2)
    result_tile = nki.make_tile([0] * len(v1))  # Initialize output tile

    # Launch the kernel
    vector_add_kernel(tile_v1, tile_v2, result_tile)

    # Retrieve and return the result as a list
    return result_tile.to_list()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    v1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    v2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
    result = vector_add(v1, v2)
    print("Result of vector addition:", result)
```

### If PyTorch is Required

If the surrounding code does require `torch`, I would suggest the following installation instructions:

```bash
# To install PyTorch, you can use pip or conda. Here is how to do it using pip:
pip install torch

# Alternatively, if you are using conda:
conda install pytorch -c pytorch
```

***In summary, I plan to check if the import of the 'torch' library is necessary. If not, I will remove it to resolve the error. If it is necessary, I will provide installation instructions to ensure the environment is set up correctly.***
