*** The error message indicates that the `torch` module is not found, which suggests that the environment in which the kernel is being executed is missing the PyTorch library. Since the kernel itself doesn't directly reference or require PyTorch, this error is likely due to an issue in the setup or the environment where the kernel is being executed. The missing `torch` module is not directly related to the kernel code provided, but it suggests that there might be a testing or execution script that relies on PyTorch being installed. ***

*** To resolve this issue, I will ensure that the appropriate environment is set up with PyTorch installed. If the intention is to run tests or additional scripts that depend on PyTorch, I will need to install it using a package manager like `pip`. For instance, I can run `pip install torch` in the terminal. Once I confirm that PyTorch is installed, I will re-run the kernel to determine if the original issue persists. ***

*** Additionally, I will verify the kernel code for any possible improvements or errors, ensuring that it correctly implements the vector addition functionality without any issues. However, since the kernel seems well-structured for the task at hand, I will focus on the environment setup first. ***

### Steps to Fix:
1. Install PyTorch:
   - Open the terminal and run the command:
     ```bash
     pip install torch
     ```
2. After installation, re-run the kernel code to check if any further issues arise.

3. If the kernel runs successfully, I will check the output to ensure it meets the expected results. If there are further issues, I will analyze them based on the specific error messages encountered. 

By following these steps, I can address the immediate problem of the missing `torch` module and ensure the kernel runs correctly.
