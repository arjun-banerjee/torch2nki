*** The error "AssertionError: Insufficient rank!" indicates that the shape of the tensor being created with `nl.zeros()` is not being interpreted correctly. Specifically, when creating a tensor, the shape must be provided as a tuple. In the original implementation, the shape was provided as an integer, which is not a valid input for the `nl.zeros()` function. To resolve this, I will ensure that the shape argument is explicitly defined as a tuple, even if it only contains one element. Additionally, I will also ensure that the input vectors are correctly indexed to accommodate the necessary operations. ***

Here is the revised version of the `vector_add_kernel`:

```python
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
from neuronxcc import nki

@nki.jit
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2):
    """
    Vector addition kernel that adds two input vectors element-wise.

    :param v1: First input vector (1D tensor).
    :param v2: Second input vector (1D tensor).
    :return: Resultant vector after addition (1D tensor).
    """
    # Assume v1 and v2 are 1D tensors of the same size
    size = v1.shape[0]

    # Create an output tensor of the same size, ensuring the shape is a tuple
    result = nl.zeros((size,), dtype=v1.dtype)

    # Define the range for the loop using affine_range
    for i in nl.affine_range(size):  # Use affine_range instead of arange for compatibility
        # Load the elements from the input tensors
        a = nl.load(v1[i:i + 1])  # Load one element for current index
        b = nl.load(v2[i:i + 1])  # Load one element for current index
        
        # Perform element-wise addition
        c = nl.add(a, b)

        # Store the result back into the output tensor
        nl.store(result[i:i + 1], c)  # Store the computed value

    return result
```

### Changes made:
1. **Tuple for Shape**: The shape for `nl.zeros` is explicitly defined as a tuple, `result = nl.zeros((size,), dtype=v1.dtype)`.
2. **Using `affine_range`**: Changed the loop iterator from `nl.arange(size)` to `nl.affine_range(size)` to ensure compatibility with NKI's requirements.
3. **Indexing**: The indexing for loading values from the input tensors remains the same, as it is already correctly using slices.

### Summary:
By ensuring that the shape for creating the output tensor is a tuple and utilizing `affine_range`, I have addressed the issues that were causing the kernel to fail. This should lead to a successful compilation and execution of the vector addition operation within the NKI framework.
