*** The error message "AssertionError: Insufficient rank!" indicates that the `nl.zeros` function is expecting a shape with a certain rank (typically a tuple), but it is receiving an integer instead. The line `result = nl.zeros(size, dtype=v1.dtype)` is meant to create a tensor of zeros with the shape of the input vectors. Since `size` is an integer, I need to convert it into a tuple format by wrapping it in parentheses, like `result = nl.zeros((size,), dtype=v1.dtype)`. This should resolve the rank issue. ***

Here's the corrected kernel:

```python
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
from neuronxcc import nki

@nki.jit
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2):
    """
    A kernel that adds two vectors element-wise.

    :param v1: First input vector (1D tensor)
    :param v2: Second input vector (1D tensor)
    :return: A tensor that contains the element-wise sum of v1 and v2
    """
    
    # Determine the size of the input vectors
    size = v1.shape[0]

    # Create an output tensor of the same size, initialized to zeros
    result = nl.zeros((size,), dtype=v1.dtype)  # Ensure the shape is a tuple

    # Perform element-wise addition using efficient loading and storing
    for i in nl.arange(size):
        # Load the elements from the input tensors
        a = nl.load(v1[i:i+1])
        b = nl.load(v2[i:i+1])
        
        # Perform element-wise addition
        c = nl.add(a, b)

        # Store the result back into the output tensor
        nl.store(result[i:i+1], c)

    return result
```

### Explanation of the Changes
1. **Shape Specification:** The most critical change was ensuring that the shape provided to `nl.zeros` is a tuple. This is done by changing the line to `result = nl.zeros((size,), dtype=v1.dtype)`.

2. **Kernel Structure:** The kernel maintains a structured approach, with clear parameter annotations and a comprehensive docstring that describes its functionality. This improves readability and maintainability.

3. **NKI Efficiency:** The use of efficient loading and storing with `nl.load()` and `nl.store()` ensures that the kernel is optimized for performance, which is crucial for operations involving large tensors.

This kernel should now function correctly without the rank error and efficiently perform element-wise addition on the input vectors.
