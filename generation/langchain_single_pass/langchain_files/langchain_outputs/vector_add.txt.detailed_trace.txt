[2025-03-22 12:20:01] System Prompt:
You are a engineer at Annapurna Labs writing efficent and correct kernels.

[2025-03-22 12:20:01] User Prompt:
Generate a custom kernel for vector addition a using AWS Neural Kernel Interface (NKI). The kernel should:
- Use the proper NKI API integration.
- Follow best practices for compilation.
- Be well-structured, modular, and maintainable.


Here is a python implementation for it:

def vector_add(v1, v2):
    """
    Adds two vectors element-wise using an explicit loop.
    :param v1: List of numbers (first vector)
    :param v2: List of numbers (second vector)
    :return: List representing the sum of the two vectors
    """
    if len(v1) != len(v2):
        raise ValueError("Vectors must be of the same length")
    
    result = []
    for i in range(len(v1)):
        result.append(v1[i] + v2[i])
    
    return result

Don't use libnrt.so.1

Make sure to return the output. Make sure to import nki: from neuronxcc import nki



```python
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
from neuronxcc import nki

@nki.jit
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2):
    # Assume v1 and v2 are 1D tensors of the same size
    size = v1.shape[0]

    # Create an output tensor of the same size
    result = nl.zeros(size, dtype=v1.dtype)

    # Define the range for the loop
    for i in nl.arange(size):
        # Load the elements from the input tensors
        a = nl.load(v1[i:i+1])
        b = nl.load(v2[i:i+1])
        
        # Perform element-wise addition
        c = nl.add(a, b)

        # Store the result back into the output tensor
        nl.store(result[i:i+1], c)

    return result
```

The error "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable" occurs because nl.zeros(size, dtype=v1.dtype) expects a tuple for the size argument, but you're passing an integer (size).

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

Certainly! Below is a structured and modular custom kernel for vector addition using the AWS Neural Kernel Interface (NKI). The kernel adheres to best practices for compilation and is designed to be maintainable. 

### NKI Kernel for Vector Addition

from neuronxcc import nki

@nki.jit
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2):
    """
    Vector addition kernel that performs element-wise addition of two input tensors.
    
    Parameters:
    v1: Input tensor (first vector)
    v2: Input tensor (second vector)
    
    Returns:
    result: Output tensor containing the sum of v1 and v2
    """
    # Validate that the input vectors have the same shape
    if v1.shape != v2.shape:
        raise ValueError("Input vectors must have the same shape")
    
    # Create an output tensor of the same shape, filled with zeros
    result = nl.zeros(v1.shape, dtype=v1.dtype)

    # Define the range for the loop
    size = v1.shape[0]  # Assume v1 is 1D for this example
    for i in nl.arange(size):
        # Load the elements from the input tensors
        a = nl.load(v1[i:i+1])  # Load a single element
        b = nl.load(v2[i:i+1])  # Load a single element
        
        # Perform element-wise addition
        c = nl.add(a, b)

        # Store the result back into the output tensor
        nl.store(result[i:i+1], c)

    return result
```

### Explanation of the Kernel:

1. **Imports**: We import necessary modules from the `neuronxcc.nki` package, which provides the NKI functionality.

2. **Kernel Definition**: The kernel `vector_add_kernel` is decorated with `@nki.jit`, enabling Just-In-Time compilation.

3. **Input Validation**: The kernel checks if the shapes of the two input tensors are the same. If they are not, it raises a `ValueError`. This step ensures that the kernel does not run into runtime errors due to shape mismatches.

4. **Output Tensor Creation**: An output tensor `result` is initialized with the same shape and data type as the inputs, filled with zeros using `nl.zeros`.

5. **Element-wise Processing**:
   - A loop iterates over the range of the tensor size.
   - Inside the loop, elements from both input tensors are loaded using `nl.load`.
   - The addition operation is performed using `nl.add`.
   - The result is stored back into the output tensor using `nl.store`.

6. **Return Statement**: Finally, the resultant tensor is returned from the kernel.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the data types and shapes of the input tensors are compatible when invoking this kernel.
- The kernel can be easily extended or modified for different types of vector operations or multi-dimensional tensors by adjusting the loop and indexing.

This implementation follows best practices for kernel development in NKI by maintaining clear structure, modularity, and ensuring data integrity through validations.

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Store into a tensor on device memory (HBM) from on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.
value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# from data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
nl.store(out_tensor, data_tile)

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:20:35] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 1:
*** The error message indicates that there is an "Insufficient rank" assertion failure when trying to create a tensor of zeros. This implies that the shape being passed to the `nl.zeros` function is not valid. In this case, the kernel assumes that the input tensors `v1` and `v2` are 1D, but it's better to handle both 1D and potentially higher-dimensional tensors to avoid this error. Additionally, I should ensure that the implementation uses proper tile sizes and indexing for loading and storing data. ***

To fix the kernel, I will modify the following parts:
1. **Dynamic Shape Handling:** Instead of assuming that `v1` and `v2` are always 1D, I will check their dimensions and make the kernel adaptable to handle n-dimensional tensors.
2. **Tile Indexing:** I will use a loop over all dimensions to perform the element-wise addition, which allows the kernel to work with any shape of input tensors.
3. **Correct Usage of Load and Store:** I will ensure that the tensors are loaded and stored correctly according to their shapes.

Here’s the updated kernel code:

```python
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
from neuronxcc import nki

@nki.jit
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2):
    """
    Vector addition kernel that performs element-wise addition of two input tensors.
    
    Parameters:
    v1: Input tensor (first vector)
    v2: Input tensor (second vector)
    
    Returns:
    result: Output tensor containing the sum of v1 and v2
    """
    # Validate that the input vectors have the same shape
    if v1.shape != v2.shape:
        raise ValueError("Input vectors must have the same shape")
    
    # Create an output tensor of the same shape, filled with zeros
    result = nl.zeros(v1.shape, dtype=v1.dtype)

    # Get the number of dimensions
    num_dims = len(v1.shape)
    
    # Generate indices for the tensor access
    indices = [nl.arange(v1.shape[i]) for i in range(num_dims)]
    
    # Use the indices to iterate through each element
    for idx in nl.meshgrid(*indices):
        # Load the elements from the input tensors
        a = nl.load(v1[tuple(idx)])
        b = nl.load(v2[tuple(idx)])
        
        # Perform element-wise addition
        c = nl.add(a, b)

        # Store the result back into the output tensor
        nl.store(result[tuple(idx)], c)

    return result
```

*** In this new code, I dynamically handle the dimensions of the input tensors, making the kernel adaptable to higher-dimensional data. I use `nl.meshgrid` to generate index tuples that can be used to access elements across all dimensions of the tensors. This should resolve the "insufficient rank" issue by ensuring that the shapes used for tensor creation and indexing are always valid. ***

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:21:06] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 2:
The error message indicates an "Insufficient rank" assertion failure which typically suggests that the tensor being operated on does not have enough dimensions for the operations being executed. In the context of the kernel function I've written, this error seems to originate from the way the output tensor is created using `nl.zeros(v1.shape, dtype=v1.dtype)`.

*** The issue arises because the shape of the output tensor should be explicit and should take into account the way the tensor is accessed and stored. Instead of directly using `v1.shape`, we should ensure that the shape is compatible with the operations that we will be performing, especially when loading and storing values. Additionally, the use of `nl.meshgrid` to generate indices may not align correctly for higher-dimensional tensors. Instead, we can utilize a more concise and efficient approach to perform element-wise operations. ***

To address the issue, I will make the following changes:
1. Create the output tensor using `nl.zeros` with proper shape management, avoiding potential mismatches.
2. Use a single loop that indexes directly through the tensor elements rather than relying on `meshgrid`, which can lead to higher complexity and potential errors in multidimensional indexing.

Here is the updated kernel code:

```python
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
from neuronxcc import nki

@nki.jit
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2):
    """
    Vector addition kernel that performs element-wise addition of two input tensors.
    
    Parameters:
    v1: Input tensor (first vector)
    v2: Input tensor (second vector)
    
    Returns:
    result: Output tensor containing the sum of v1 and v2
    """
    # Validate that the input vectors have the same shape
    if v1.shape != v2.shape:
        raise ValueError("Input vectors must have the same shape")
    
    # Create an output tensor of the same shape, filled with zeros
    result = nl.zeros(v1.shape, dtype=v1.dtype)

    # Calculate the number of elements in the tensor
    num_elements = nl.prod(v1.shape)  # Get the total number of elements
    
    # Iterate over each element
    for idx in nl.arange(num_elements):
        # Compute the multi-dimensional index from the flat index
        multi_idx = nl.unravel_index(idx, v1.shape)
        
        # Load the elements from the input tensors
        a = nl.load(v1[multi_idx])
        b = nl.load(v2[multi_idx])
        
        # Perform element-wise addition
        c = nl.add(a, b)

        # Store the result back into the output tensor
        nl.store(result[multi_idx], c)

    return result
```

*** In this revised version, I've replaced the meshgrid and tuple indexing with a more straightforward handling using a flat index approach with `nl.arange` and `nl.unravel_index`. This should maintain the correct shape and dimension expectations, addressing the "Insufficient rank" error. This change will simplify the code and make it more robust against shape-related issues. ***

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

Also supports indirect DMA access with dynamic index values:

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Store into a tensor on device memory (HBM) from on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.
value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM

[2025-03-22 12:21:25] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 3:
*** The error message indicates an "Insufficient rank" assertion failure when attempting to create a tensor filled with zeros using `nl.zeros(v1.shape, dtype=v1.dtype)`. This usually suggests that the shape provided to `nl.zeros` is not valid, likely because the tensor shape is not being correctly interpreted as a valid multi-dimensional shape. In the context of the kernel I'm writing, it’s important to ensure that the shapes fed into these functions are always valid and correspond to what the functions expect. A common source of this issue arises when the input vectors are single-dimensional or have shapes that the NKI (Neuron Kernel Interface) does not handle as expected. Therefore, I'll ensure the shapes are explicitly verified and modified if necessary to prevent this error. ***

Here’s the revised kernel code with necessary adjustments:

*** In this revision, I've added a check to ensure that both input tensors have a non-zero rank (i.e., they are not scalars). This should prevent the "Insufficient rank" assertion failure when creating the output tensor with `nl.zeros`.

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Store into a tensor on device memory (HBM) from on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:21:58] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 4:
*** The error message "Insufficient rank" indicates that the kernel is trying to create an output tensor with a shape that the NKI environment considers invalid. This often happens when the shape passed to functions like `nl.zeros` does not have the required dimensions or is malformed. In this case, both `v1` and `v2` must be validated for their rank (number of dimensions) before calling `nl.zeros`. The current validation checks for a non-zero rank but does not ensure that the rank is sufficient for tensor operations expected in NKI. I will modify the code to correct the shape and validation logic. ***

Here is the revised kernel code:

```python
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
from neuronxcc import nki

@nki.jit
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2):
    """
    Vector addition kernel that performs element-wise addition of two input tensors.
    
    Parameters:
    v1: Input tensor (first vector)
    v2: Input tensor (second vector)
    
    Returns:
    result: Output tensor containing the sum of v1 and v2
    """
    # Validate that the input vectors have the same shape
    if v1.shape != v2.shape:
        raise ValueError("Input vectors must have the same shape")
    
    # Ensure both tensors have a valid shape for NKI
    if len(v1.shape) < 1 or len(v2.shape) < 1:
        raise ValueError("Input vectors must have at least one dimension")
    
    # Create an output tensor of the same shape, filled with zeros
    result = nl.zeros(v1.shape, dtype=v1.dtype)

    # Calculate the number of elements in the tensor
    num_elements = nl.prod(v1.shape)  # Get the total number of elements
    
    # Iterate over each element
    for idx in nl.arange(num_elements):
        # Compute the multi-dimensional index from the flat index
        multi_idx = nl.unravel_index(idx, v1.shape)
        
        # Load the elements from the input tensors

        b = nl.load(v2[multi_idx])
        
        # Perform element-wise addition
        c = nl.add(a, b)

        # Store the result back into the output tensor
        nl.store(result[multi_idx], c)

    return result
```

*** In this revised version, I changed the validation check for the rank of `v1` and `v2` from checking for a non-zero rank to ensuring that the rank is at least one (i.e., the tensors must have at least one dimension). This correction ensures that when we attempt to create the `result` tensor with `nl.zeros`, the shape is compliant with the NKI requirements. Now it should handle tensor shapes more robustly and avoid the "Insufficient rank" error. ***

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

Also supports indirect DMA access with dynamic index values:

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:22:26] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 5:
*** The error message "Insufficient rank" indicates that the kernel is trying to create an output tensor with a shape that does not meet the required rank specifications for the NKI framework. This typically happens if the input vectors are not structured properly for the operations being performed. Specifically, in my kernel, I am using `nl.zeros(v1.shape, dtype=v1.dtype)` to initialize the result tensor. If `v1.shape` is empty or improperly defined due to the nature of the inputs, it can lead to this error.

To fix this, I will ensure that the input tensors are multidimensional and have at least one dimension. Moreover, I will utilize a batching mechanism to ensure proper handling of input tensors, especially if they are intended to be 3D or higher dimensional in scenarios where the shapes could lead to rank issues. I will adapt the `nl.zeros` and the subsequent operations to ensure proper handling of the tensor shapes. I will also enhance the logic to iterate over each dimension properly instead of flattening the tensor. ***

Here is the revised kernel code:

```python
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
from neuronxcc import nki

@nki.jit
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2):
    """
    Vector addition kernel that performs element-wise addition of two input tensors.

    Returns:
    result: Output tensor containing the sum of v1 and v2
    """
    # Validate that the input vectors have the same shape
    if v1.shape != v2.shape:
        raise ValueError("Input vectors must have the same shape")

    if len(v1.shape) < 1 or len(v2.shape) < 1:
        raise ValueError("Input vectors must have at least one dimension")
    
    # Create an output tensor of the same shape, filled with zeros
    result = nl.zeros(v1.shape, dtype=v1.dtype)

    # Calculate the number of elements in the tensor
    num_elements = nl.prod(v1.shape)  # Get the total number of elements
    
    # Using multi-dimensional indexing to properly iterate over the tensor

        # Store the result back into the output tensor
        nl.store(result[multi_idx], c)

    return result
```

*** In this revised kernel:
1. I retained the checks for the shape of the tensors to ensure they are valid prior to proceeding.
2. I ensured that the initialization of `result` maintains the correct dimensions to avoid rank issues.
3. I preserved the logic for element-wise addition but retained the original multi-dimensional indexing approach to access the array elements properly.

This should resolve the "Insufficient rank" error and ensure that the kernel functions correctly for valid input tensors. ***

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

Also supports indirect DMA access with dynamic index values:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Store into a tensor on device memory (HBM) from on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.
value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
none

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# from data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
nl.store(out_tensor, data_tile)

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:23:31] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 6:
*** The error message "Insufficient rank" suggests that the kernel is attempting to create an output tensor with an invalid or unsupported shape. This is typically due to the way the `zeros` function is called, which requires that the `shape` argument passed to it is appropriate for the NKI (Neuron Kernel Interface) environment. The problem may arise if the input tensors have less than two dimensions or if the shape of the tensor is not compatible with NKI's requirements. ***

*** My plan is to ensure that the tensor shapes are correctly handled so that they have at least two dimensions when creating the output tensor with `nl.zeros()`. Specifically, I will modify the kernel to create the output tensor only if the input vectors are valid. If they are 1D vectors (having a shape like `(N,)`), I will ensure to create the result tensor as a 2D tensor of shape `(N, 1)` to avoid the rank issue. ***

Here is the revised kernel code:

        result_shape = v1.shape

        nl.store(result[multi_idx], c)

    return result
```

*** In this revised code, I added a check to determine if the input vectors are 1D and adjusted the shape of the output tensor accordingly. If they are 1D, I create a result tensor with an additional dimension, which should resolve the "Insufficient rank" error.

x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.
value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# from data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
nl.store(out_tensor, data_tile)

nki.language.prod

Signature:
nki.language.prod(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Product of elements along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.prod))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
keepdims – If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

Returns:
a tile with the product of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix.

*** The error message indicates that the function `nl.prod` is being called without the required 'axis' argument. The `prod` function in the NKI library requires an 'axis' parameter to specify along which dimension to compute the product.

Instead of using `nl.prod(v1.shape)` to calculate the total number of elements, I'll change it to a simple multiplication of the dimensions in the shape. This will correctly give us the number of elements without needing to use `nl.prod`, which is causing the error. ***

--------------------------------------------------
ERROR: 1d-arange-not-supported
==================================================
Instruction 1: Indexing a NKI tensor with 1D arange is not supported.
Instruction 2: NKI expects tile indices to have at least two dimensions to match the underlying
memory (SBUF or PSUM)
Instruction 3: You can workaround the problem by introducing new axes like the following code:
Instruction 4: Or using simple slicing:
Code Example 1:
 tmp = nl . zeros (( 128 , 1 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) i = nl . arange ( 64 ) c = nl . exp ( tmp [ i , 0 ]) # Error: indexing tensor `tmp` with 1d arange is not supported,
Code Example 2:
 tmp = nl . zeros (( 128 , 1 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) i = nl . arange ( 64 )[:, None ] c = nl . exp ( tmp [ i , 0 ])
Code Example 3:

Instruction 1: Bias parameter of activation or activation_reduce must be a vector of type float32, float16, or bfloat16.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], bias = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], bias = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = nl . bfloat16 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], bias = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . int8 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: activation-scale-invalid-type
==================================================
Instruction 1: Scale parameter of activation or activation_reduce must be a scalar or vector of type float32.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = 1.2 ) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float16 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: activation-scale-scalar-or-vector
==================================================
Instruction 1: Scale parameter of activation must be either a scalar value or a 1D vector spanning the partition dimension.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = 1.2 ) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 1 , 128 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # not supported nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 128 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: annotation-shape-mismatch
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor shape and the annotated shape mismatch
Instruction 2: NKI check the object shape based on python type annotation in thetarget: type = valuesyntax,
NKI will throw an error if the expected shape and the object shape mismatch.
Instruction 3: For example:
Code Example 1:
 import  neuronxcc.nki.typing  as  nt data : nt . tensor [ 128 , 512 ] = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) # Error: shape of `data[128, 128]` does not match the expected shape of [128, 512]

============================================================

ERROR: bias-tensor-must-be-specified-in-allocation

============================================================

ERROR: cannot-assign-to-index
==================================================
Instruction 1: Anindextensor does not support item assignment. You may explicitly calliotato convert anindextensor to a normaltilebefore any assignments.
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] x [ 0 , 5 ] = 1024 # Error: 'index' tensor does not support item assignment y = nisa . iota ( x , dtype = nl . uint32 ) y [ 0 , 5 ] = 1024 # works

============================================================

ERROR: cannot-update-immutable-parameter
==================================================
Instruction 1: Cannot update immutable parameter
Instruction 2: By default all parameters to the top level nki kernels are immutable, updating
immutable parameters in the kernel is not allowed.
Instruction 3: To fix this error, you could copy the parameter to a temp buffer and modify the buffer instead:
Code Example 1:
 def  kernel ( in_tensor ): x = nl . load ( in_tensor ) y = x + 1 # Parameter `in_tensor` is immutable by default, cannot modify immutable parameter nl . store ( in_tensor , value = y ) # Error: Cannot update immutable parameter return in_tensor
Code Example 2:

ERROR: control-flow-condition-depending-on-arange
==================================================
Instruction 1: Control-flow depending onnl.arangeornl.mgridis not supported.
Instruction 2: In the above example, j depends on the value ofi1, which isnl.arange(512)[None, :].
NKI does not support usingnl.arangeornl.mgridin control-flow condition.
To workaround this error, you can use themaskparameter:
Code Example 1:
 for j0 in nl . affine_range ( 4096 ): i1 = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] j = j0 * 512 + i1 if j > 2048 : # Error: Control-flow depending on `nl.arange` or `nl.mgrid` is not supported y = nl . add ( x [ 0 , j ], x [ 0 , j - 2048 ])
Code Example 2:
 for j0 in nl . affine_range ( 4096 ): i1 = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] j = j0 * 512 + i1 y = nl . add ( x [ 0 , j ], x [ 0 , j - 2048 ], mask = j > 2048 )

============================================================

ERROR: dynamic-control-flow-not-supported
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is currently not supported by NKI.
Code Example 1:
 cnd = nl . load ( a ) # a have shape of [1, 1] if cnd : # Error: dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is not supported. nl . store ( b , 1 )

============================================================

ERROR: exceed-max-supported-dimension
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI API tensor parameter exceeds max supported number of dimensions.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on how many dimensions the tensor parameter can have:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 32 , 2 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: parameter 'x[64, 32, 2]' of 'transpose' exceed max supported number of dimensions of 2. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 64 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works if input `x` only have 2 dimensions (i.e. rank=2)

============================================================

ERROR: failed-to-infer-tile-from-local-tensor
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI requires inputs of all compute APIs to be valid tiles with the first dimension
being the partition dimension.
Instruction 2: To fix the problem you can use index tensorato generate a tile whose first dimension is the partition dimension
Code Example 1:
 # We mark the second dimension as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . add ( a , 32 ) # Error: Failed to infer tile from tensor 'a',
Code Example 2:
 # We mark the second dimension of tensor a as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . ndarray (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in range ( 4 ): # result of `a[i]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i ] = nl . add ( a [ i ], 32 ) # works # Or explicitly generate a tile with `nl.arange` ix = nl . arange ( 8 )[:, None ] iy = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] # result of `a[i, ix, iy]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i , ix , iy ] = nl . add ( a [ i , ix , iy ], 32 ) # also works

============================================================

ERROR: indirect-indices-free-dim
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic indexing for load/store only supports the indirect indexing
to be on the partition or block dimension. Refer to the code examples innl.loadandnl.store.
Instruction 2: Also, if you’re usingnl.mgridyou may get this error even though your indirect indexing
was on the partition dimension, usenl.arangeinstead.
Code Example 1:
nl.mgrid
Code Example 2:
nl.arange
Code Example 3:
 i_p , i_f = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 64 , 0 : 512 ] # this won't work for dynamic access i_p = nl . arange ( 64 )[:, None ] # this works for dynamic access i_f = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] data_tile = nl . load ( data_tensor [ idx_tile [ i_p , 0 ], i_f ])

============================================================

ERROR: local-variable-used-out-of-scope
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensors in NKI are not allowed to be used outside of their parent scope.
Instruction 2: Tensors in NKI have a stricter scope rules than Python. In NKI, control blocks
in if/else/for statements will introduce their own scope for tensors. A tensor
defined in if/else/for control blocks are not allowed to be used outside of the
scope.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you can rewrite the above code as:
Instruction 4: This stricter scope rules may also introduce unexpected error like the following:
Instruction 5: To fix the problem you can follow the suggestion from the warning
Code Example 1:
 for i in range ( 4 ): if i < 2 : tmp = nl . load ( a ) else : tmp = nl . load ( b ) nl . store ( c , tmp ) # Error: Local variable 'tmp' is referenced outside of its parent scope ...
Code Example 2:

Code Example 3:
 data = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) for i in nl . sequential_range ( 4 ): i_tile = nisa . iota ( i , dtype = nl . uint32 ) . broadcast_to ( data . shape ) data = data + i_tile # Warning: shadowing local tensor 'float32 data[128, 128]' with a new object, use 'data[...] =' if you want to update the existing object nl . store ( ptr , value = data ) # # Error: Local variable 'tmp' is referenced outside of its parent scope ...
Code Example 4:

ERROR: num-partition-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: NKI requires the number of partitions of a tile to not exceed the architecture limitation of 128
Instruction 3: For example in Trainium:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 256 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Error: number of partitions 256 exceed architecture limitation of 128. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Works

============================================================

ERROR: num-partition-mismatch
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions mismatch.
Instruction 2: Most of the APIs in the nki.isa module require all operands to have the same number of partitions.
For example, the nki.isa.tensor_tensor() requires all operands to have the same number of partitions.
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y0 = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 1 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # Error: number of partitions (dimension 0 size of a tile) mismatch in parameters (data1[128, 512], data2[1, 512]) of 'tensor_tensor' y1 = y0 . broadcast_to ([ 128 , 512 ]) # Call `broadcast_to` to explicitly broadcast on the partition dimension z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # works because x and y1 has the same number of partitions

Instruction 1: shared_hbm tensor can only be created in top level kernel scope
Instruction 2: Creating shared_hbm tensors inside a loop, under if condition
or inside another function called by the top-level nki kernel
is not supported.
Instruction 3: Consider hoist the creation of shared_hbm tensors to the top
level kernel scope.
Code Example 1:

============================================================

ERROR: size-of-dimension-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Size of dimension exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on dimension sizes of the parameter tensor:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: size of dimension 1 in 'x[128, 512]' of 'transpose' exceed architecture limitation of 128. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 128 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works size of dimension 1 < 128

============================================================

ERROR: store-dst-shape-smaller-than-other-shape
==================================================
Instruction 1: Illegal shape in assignment destination.
Instruction 2: The destination of assignment must have the same or bigger shape than the source
of assignment. Assigning multiple values to the same element in the assignment
destination from a single NKI API is not supported
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = ( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y = nl . zeros ( shape = ( 128 , 1 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y [ ... ] = x # Error: Illegal assignment destination shape in 'a = b': shape [128, 1] of parameter 'a' is smaller than other parameter shapes b[128, 512]. x [ ... ] = y # ok, if we are broadcasting from source to the destination of the assignment

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-access-out-of-bound
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor access out-of-bound.
Instruction 2: Out-of-bound access is considered illegal in NKI. When the indices are calculated
from nki indexing APIs, out-of-bound access results in a compile-time error.
When the indices are calculated dynamically at run-time, such as indirect
memory accesses, out-of-bound access results in run-time exceptions during
execution of the kernel.
Instruction 3: You could carefully check the corresponding indices and make necessary correction.
If the indices are correct and intentional, out-of-bound access can be avoided by
providing a proper mask:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . ndarray ([ 128 , 4000 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) for i in nl . affine_range (( 4000 + 512 - 1 ) // 512 ): tile = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 128 , 0 : 512 ] nl . store ( x [ tile . p , i * 512 + tile . x ], value = 0 ) # Error: Out-of-bound access for tensor `x` on dimension 1: index range [0, 4095] exceed dimension size of 4000
Code Example 2:
 x = nl . ndarray ([ 128 , 4000 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) for i in nl . affine_range (( 4000 + 512 - 1 ) // 512 ): tile = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 128 , 0 : 512 ] nl . store ( x [ tile . p , i * 512 + tile . x ], value = 0 , mask = i * 512 + tile . x < 4000 ) # Ok

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-creation-on-scratchpad-with-init-value-not-allowed

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-output-not-written-to
==================================================
Instruction 1: A tensor was either passed as an output parameter to kernel but never written to, or
no output parameter was passed to the kernel at all. At least one output parameter
must be provided to kernels.
Instruction 2: If you did pass an output parameter to your kernel, and this still occurred, this means the tensor
was never written to. The most common cause for this is a dead-loop, such as when a range expression
evaluates to 0 and the loop performing the store operation is not actually being entered. But this can occur
in any situation in which a loop is never entered, regardless of flow-control construct (for, if, while, etc..)
Instruction 3: Consider doing the following:
Instruction 4: Evaluate your range expressions and conditionals to make sure they’re what you intended. If you were trying to perform
a computation on tiles smaller than your numerator (M in this case), use math.ceil() around your
range expression. e.g. nl.affine_range(math.ceil(M / N)). You will likely need to pass a mask to your
load and store operations as well to account for this.
Instruction 5: If the possible dead-loop is intentional, you need to issue a store that writes to the entire tensor
somewhere in the kernel outside of the dead loop. One good way to do this is to invokestore()on your output tensor with a default value.
Instruction 6: For example:
Code Example 1:
 def  incorrect ( tensor_in , tensor_out ): M = 128 N = M + 1 for i in nl . affine_range ( M // N ): # This is the cause of the error, as N > M, M // N will evaluate to 0 a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called. def  also_incorrect_in_the_same_way ( tensor_in , tensor_out , cnd ): # This will cause the error if the value of `cnd` is False while cnd : a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called.
Code Example 2:
 def  memset_output ( input , output , cnd ): # Initialize the output if we cannot guarantee the output are always written later nl . store ( output [ i_p , i_f ], value = 0 ) while cnd : # Ok even if the value of `cnd` is False a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a )

ERROR: unexpected-output-dependencies
==================================================
Instruction 1: Unexpected output dependencies.
Instruction 2: NKI assume kernel instances in the spmd grid and iteration between affine_range
can be executed in parallel require synchronization on the output. As a result,
each iteration of the loop will write to a different memory location.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you could either index the destination with the missing indices:
Instruction 4: Or if you want to write to the same memory location, you could usesequential_rangewhich allows writing to the same memory location:
Code Example 1:

dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: prod
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.prod

Signature:
nki.language.prod(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Product of elements along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.prod))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
keepdims – If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

Returns:
a tile with the product of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: affine_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.affine_range

Signature:
nki.language.affine_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as parallel loop iterators in NKI. affine_range should be the default loop iterator choice, when there is no loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. A concrete example of associative reduction is multiple nl.matmul or nisa.nc_matmul calls accumulating into the same output buffer defined outside of this loop level (see code example #2 below).
When the above conditions are not met, we recommend using sequential_range instead.

Notes:
Using affine_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using affine_range also allows Neuron compiler to perform additional loop-level optimizations, such as loop vectorization in current release. The exact type of loop-level optimizations applied is subject to changes in future releases.
Since each kernel instance only runs on a single NeuronCore, affine_range does not parallelize different loop iterations across multiple NeuronCores. However, different iterations could be parallelized/pipelined on different compute engines within a NeuronCore depending on the invoked instructions (engines) and data dependency in the loop body.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

 3#######################################################################
 4# Example 1: No loop carried dependency
 5# Input/Output tensor shape: [128, 2048]

 7# and store it into output tile
 8#######################################################################

10# Every loop instance works on an independent input/output tile.
11# No data dependency between loop instances.
12for i_input in nl.affine_range(input.shape[1] // 512):
13  offset = i_input * 512
14  input_sb = nl.load(input[0:input.shape[0], offset:offset+512])
15  result = nl.multiply(input_sb, input_sb)
16  nl.store(output[0:input.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)

22# accumulate into the same output buffer

25result_psum = nl.zeros((128, 128), dtype=nl.float32, buffer=nl.psum)

27  offset = i_K * 128
28  xT_sbuf = nl.load(offset:offset+128, 0:xT.shape[1]])
29  y_sbuf = nl.load(offset:offset+128, 0:y.shape[1]])
30
31  result_psum += nl.matmul(xT_sbuf, y_sbuf, transpose_x=True)

================================================================================

FUNCTION: sequential_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.sequential_range

Signature:
nki.language.sequential_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as sequential loop iterators in NKI. sequential_range should be used when there is a loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. See affine_range for an example of such associative reduction.

Notes:
Inside a NKI kernel, any use of Python range(...) will be replaced with sequential_range(...) by Neuron compiler.
Using sequential_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using sequential_range informs Neuron compiler to respect inter-loop dependency and perform much more conservative loop-level optimizations compared to affine_range.
Using affine_range instead of sequential_range in case of loop carried dependency incorrectly is considered unsafe and could lead to numerical errors.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
 2
 3#######################################################################
 4# Example 1: Loop carried dependency from tiling tensor_tensor_scan
 5# Both sbuf tensor input0 and input1 shapes: [128, 2048]
 6# Perform a scan operation between the two inputs using a tile size of [128, 512]
 7# Store the scan output to another [128, 2048] tensor
 8#######################################################################
 9
10# Loop iterations communicate through this init tensor
11init = nl.zeros((128, 1), dtype=input0.dtype)
12
13# This loop will only produce correct results if the iterations are performed in order
14for i_input in nl.sequential_range(input0.shape[1] // 512):
15  offset = i_input * 512
16
17  # Depends on scan result from the previous loop iteration
18  result = nisa.tensor_tensor_scan(input0[:, offset:offset+512],
19                                   input1[:, offset:offset+512],
20                                   initial=init,
21                                   op0=nl.multiply, op1=nl.add)
22
23  nl.store(output[0:input0.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)
24
25  # Prepare initial result for scan in the next loop iteration
26  init[:, :] = result[:, 511]

================================================================================

FUNCTION: static_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.static_range

Signature:
nki.language.static_range(*args)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as loop iterators in NKI, resulting in a fully unrolled loop. Unlike affine_range or sequential_range, Neuron compiler will fully unroll the loop during NKI kernel tracing.

Notes:
Due to loop unrolling, compilation time may go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
On-chip memory (SBUF) usage may also go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
No loop-level optimizations will be performed in the compiler.
static_range should only be used as a fall-back option for debugging purposes when affine_range or sequential_range is giving functionally incorrect results or undesirable performance characteristics.

============================================================

ERROR: activation-scale-invalid-type
==================================================
Instruction 1: Scale parameter of activation or activation_reduce must be a scalar or vector of type float32.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = 1.2 ) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float16 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: annotation-shape-mismatch
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor shape and the annotated shape mismatch
Instruction 2: NKI check the object shape based on python type annotation in thetarget: type = valuesyntax,
NKI will throw an error if the expected shape and the object shape mismatch.
Instruction 3: For example:
Code Example 1:
 import  neuronxcc.nki.typing  as  nt data : nt . tensor [ 128 , 512 ] = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) # Error: shape of `data[128, 128]` does not match the expected shape of [128, 512]

============================================================

ERROR: cannot-assign-to-index
==================================================
Instruction 1: Anindextensor does not support item assignment. You may explicitly calliotato convert anindextensor to a normaltilebefore any assignments.
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] x [ 0 , 5 ] = 1024 # Error: 'index' tensor does not support item assignment y = nisa . iota ( x , dtype = nl . uint32 ) y [ 0 , 5 ] = 1024 # works

============================================================

ERROR: cannot-update-immutable-parameter
==================================================
Instruction 1: Cannot update immutable parameter
Instruction 2: By default all parameters to the top level nki kernels are immutable, updating
immutable parameters in the kernel is not allowed.
Instruction 3: To fix this error, you could copy the parameter to a temp buffer and modify the buffer instead:
Code Example 1:
 def  kernel ( in_tensor ): x = nl . load ( in_tensor ) y = x + 1 # Parameter `in_tensor` is immutable by default, cannot modify immutable parameter nl . store ( in_tensor , value = y ) # Error: Cannot update immutable parameter return in_tensor
Code Example 2:

============================================================

ERROR: control-flow-condition-depending-on-arange
==================================================
Instruction 1: Control-flow depending onnl.arangeornl.mgridis not supported.
Instruction 2: In the above example, j depends on the value ofi1, which isnl.arange(512)[None, :].
NKI does not support usingnl.arangeornl.mgridin control-flow condition.
To workaround this error, you can use themaskparameter:
Code Example 1:
 for j0 in nl . affine_range ( 4096 ): i1 = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] j = j0 * 512 + i1 if j > 2048 : # Error: Control-flow depending on `nl.arange` or `nl.mgrid` is not supported y = nl . add ( x [ 0 , j ], x [ 0 , j - 2048 ])
Code Example 2:
 for j0 in nl . affine_range ( 4096 ): i1 = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] j = j0 * 512 + i1 y = nl . add ( x [ 0 , j ], x [ 0 , j - 2048 ], mask = j > 2048 )

============================================================

ERROR: dynamic-control-flow-not-supported
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is currently not supported by NKI.
Code Example 1:
 cnd = nl . load ( a ) # a have shape of [1, 1] if cnd : # Error: dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is not supported. nl . store ( b , 1 )

============================================================

ERROR: exceed-max-supported-dimension
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI API tensor parameter exceeds max supported number of dimensions.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on how many dimensions the tensor parameter can have:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 32 , 2 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: parameter 'x[64, 32, 2]' of 'transpose' exceed max supported number of dimensions of 2. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 64 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works if input `x` only have 2 dimensions (i.e. rank=2)

============================================================

ERROR: failed-to-infer-tile-from-local-tensor
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI requires inputs of all compute APIs to be valid tiles with the first dimension
being the partition dimension.
Instruction 2: To fix the problem you can use index tensorato generate a tile whose first dimension is the partition dimension
Code Example 1:
 # We mark the second dimension as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . add ( a , 32 ) # Error: Failed to infer tile from tensor 'a',
Code Example 2:
 # We mark the second dimension of tensor a as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . ndarray (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in range ( 4 ): # result of `a[i]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i ] = nl . add ( a [ i ], 32 ) # works # Or explicitly generate a tile with `nl.arange` ix = nl . arange ( 8 )[:, None ] iy = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] # result of `a[i, ix, iy]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i , ix , iy ] = nl . add ( a [ i , ix , iy ], 32 ) # also works

============================================================

ERROR: indirect-indices-free-dim
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic indexing for load/store only supports the indirect indexing
to be on the partition or block dimension. Refer to the code examples innl.loadandnl.store.
Instruction 2: Also, if you’re usingnl.mgridyou may get this error even though your indirect indexing
was on the partition dimension, usenl.arangeinstead.
Code Example 1:
nl.mgrid
Code Example 2:
nl.arange
Code Example 3:
 i_p , i_f = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 64 , 0 : 512 ] # this won't work for dynamic access i_p = nl . arange ( 64 )[:, None ] # this works for dynamic access i_f = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] data_tile = nl . load ( data_tensor [ idx_tile [ i_p , 0 ], i_f ])

============================================================

ERROR: local-variable-used-out-of-scope
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensors in NKI are not allowed to be used outside of their parent scope.
Instruction 2: Tensors in NKI have a stricter scope rules than Python. In NKI, control blocks
in if/else/for statements will introduce their own scope for tensors. A tensor
defined in if/else/for control blocks are not allowed to be used outside of the
scope.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you can rewrite the above code as:
Instruction 4: This stricter scope rules may also introduce unexpected error like the following:
Instruction 5: To fix the problem you can follow the suggestion from the warning
Code Example 1:
 for i in range ( 4 ): if i < 2 : tmp = nl . load ( a ) else : tmp = nl . load ( b ) nl . store ( c , tmp ) # Error: Local variable 'tmp' is referenced outside of its parent scope ...
Code Example 2:

Code Example 3:
 data = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) for i in nl . sequential_range ( 4 ): i_tile = nisa . iota ( i , dtype = nl . uint32 ) . broadcast_to ( data . shape ) data = data + i_tile # Warning: shadowing local tensor 'float32 data[128, 128]' with a new object, use 'data[...] =' if you want to update the existing object nl . store ( ptr , value = data ) # # Error: Local variable 'tmp' is referenced outside of its parent scope ...
Code Example 4:
 data = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) for i in nl . sequential_range ( 4 ): i_tile = nisa . iota ( i , dtype = nl . uint32 ) . broadcast_to ( data . shape ) data [ ... ] = data + i_tile nl . store ( ptr , value = data )

============================================================

ERROR: nki-api-outside-of-nki-kernel
==================================================
Instruction 1: Calling NKI API outside of NKI kernels is not supported.
Instruction 2: Make sure the NKI kernel function decorated withnki.jit.

============================================================

ERROR: num-partition-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: NKI requires the number of partitions of a tile to not exceed the architecture limitation of 128
Instruction 3: For example in Trainium:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 256 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Error: number of partitions 256 exceed architecture limitation of 128. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Works

============================================================

ERROR: num-partition-mismatch
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions mismatch.
Instruction 2: Most of the APIs in the nki.isa module require all operands to have the same number of partitions.
For example, the nki.isa.tensor_tensor() requires all operands to have the same number of partitions.
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y0 = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 1 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # Error: number of partitions (dimension 0 size of a tile) mismatch in parameters (data1[128, 512], data2[1, 512]) of 'tensor_tensor' y1 = y0 . broadcast_to ([ 128 , 512 ]) # Call `broadcast_to` to explicitly broadcast on the partition dimension z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # works because x and y1 has the same number of partitions

============================================================

ERROR: shared-hbm-must-in-kernel-level
==================================================
Instruction 1: shared_hbm tensor can only be created in top level kernel scope
Instruction 2: Creating shared_hbm tensors inside a loop, under if condition
or inside another function called by the top-level nki kernel
is not supported.
Instruction 3: Consider hoist the creation of shared_hbm tensors to the top
level kernel scope.
Code Example 1:

============================================================

ERROR: size-of-dimension-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Size of dimension exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on dimension sizes of the parameter tensor:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: size of dimension 1 in 'x[128, 512]' of 'transpose' exceed architecture limitation of 128. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 128 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works size of dimension 1 < 128

============================================================

ERROR: store-dst-shape-smaller-than-other-shape
==================================================
Instruction 1: Illegal shape in assignment destination.
Instruction 2: The destination of assignment must have the same or bigger shape than the source
of assignment. Assigning multiple values to the same element in the assignment
destination from a single NKI API is not supported
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = ( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y = nl . zeros ( shape = ( 128 , 1 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y [ ... ] = x # Error: Illegal assignment destination shape in 'a = b': shape [128, 1] of parameter 'a' is smaller than other parameter shapes b[128, 512]. x [ ... ] = y # ok, if we are broadcasting from source to the destination of the assignment

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-access-out-of-bound
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor access out-of-bound.
Instruction 2: Out-of-bound access is considered illegal in NKI. When the indices are calculated
from nki indexing APIs, out-of-bound access results in a compile-time error.
When the indices are calculated dynamically at run-time, such as indirect
memory accesses, out-of-bound access results in run-time exceptions during
execution of the kernel.
Instruction 3: You could carefully check the corresponding indices and make necessary correction.
If the indices are correct and intentional, out-of-bound access can be avoided by
providing a proper mask:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . ndarray ([ 128 , 4000 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) for i in nl . affine_range (( 4000 + 512 - 1 ) // 512 ): tile = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 128 , 0 : 512 ] nl . store ( x [ tile . p , i * 512 + tile . x ], value = 0 ) # Error: Out-of-bound access for tensor `x` on dimension 1: index range [0, 4095] exceed dimension size of 4000
Code Example 2:
 x = nl . ndarray ([ 128 , 4000 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) for i in nl . affine_range (( 4000 + 512 - 1 ) // 512 ): tile = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 128 , 0 : 512 ] nl . store ( x [ tile . p , i * 512 + tile . x ], value = 0 , mask = i * 512 + tile . x < 4000 ) # Ok

ERROR: tensor-output-not-written-to
==================================================
Instruction 1: A tensor was either passed as an output parameter to kernel but never written to, or
no output parameter was passed to the kernel at all. At least one output parameter
must be provided to kernels.
Instruction 2: If you did pass an output parameter to your kernel, and this still occurred, this means the tensor
was never written to. The most common cause for this is a dead-loop, such as when a range expression
evaluates to 0 and the loop performing the store operation is not actually being entered. But this can occur
in any situation in which a loop is never entered, regardless of flow-control construct (for, if, while, etc..)
Instruction 3: Consider doing the following:
Instruction 4: Evaluate your range expressions and conditionals to make sure they’re what you intended. If you were trying to perform
a computation on tiles smaller than your numerator (M in this case), use math.ceil() around your
range expression. e.g. nl.affine_range(math.ceil(M / N)). You will likely need to pass a mask to your
load and store operations as well to account for this.
Instruction 5: If the possible dead-loop is intentional, you need to issue a store that writes to the entire tensor
somewhere in the kernel outside of the dead loop. One good way to do this is to invokestore()on your output tensor with a default value.
Instruction 6: For example:
Code Example 1:
 def  incorrect ( tensor_in , tensor_out ): M = 128 N = M + 1 for i in nl . affine_range ( M // N ): # This is the cause of the error, as N > M, M // N will evaluate to 0 a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called. def  also_incorrect_in_the_same_way ( tensor_in , tensor_out , cnd ): # This will cause the error if the value of `cnd` is False while cnd : a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called.
Code Example 2:
 def  memset_output ( input , output , cnd ): # Initialize the output if we cannot guarantee the output are always written later nl . store ( output [ i_p , i_f ], value = 0 ) while cnd : # Ok even if the value of `cnd` is False a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a )

==================================================
Instruction 1: Unsupported transpose case in allocated NKI kernels:

Instruction 3: nl.matmul() without setting transpose_x=True.
Instruction 4: User must use their own allocated identity matrix, and call nisa.nc_matmul() explicitly to perform
transpose on TensorEngine.

Vector ) # pass

ERROR: unexpected-output-dependencies
==================================================
Instruction 1: Unexpected output dependencies.
Instruction 2: NKI assume kernel instances in the spmd grid and iteration between affine_range
can be executed in parallel require synchronization on the output. As a result,
each iteration of the loop will write to a different memory location.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you could either index the destination with the missing indices:
Instruction 4: Or if you want to write to the same memory location, you could usesequential_rangewhich allows writing to the same memory location:
Code Example 1:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . affine_range ( 4 ): a [ 0 ] = 0 # Unexpected output dependencies, different iterations of i loop write to `a[0]`
Code Example 2:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . affine_range ( 4 ): a [ i ] = 0 # Ok
Code Example 3:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . sequential_range ( 4 ): a [ 0 ] = 0 # Also ok, we dont expect the sequential_range to execute in parallel

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:

See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:

FUNCTION: prod
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.prod

Signature:
nki.language.prod(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Product of elements along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.prod))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
keepdims – If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

Returns:
a tile with the product of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: affine_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.affine_range

Signature:
nki.language.affine_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as parallel loop iterators in NKI. affine_range should be the default loop iterator choice, when there is no loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. A concrete example of associative reduction is multiple nl.matmul or nisa.nc_matmul calls accumulating into the same output buffer defined outside of this loop level (see code example #2 below).
When the above conditions are not met, we recommend using sequential_range instead.

Notes:
Using affine_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using affine_range also allows Neuron compiler to perform additional loop-level optimizations, such as loop vectorization in current release. The exact type of loop-level optimizations applied is subject to changes in future releases.
Since each kernel instance only runs on a single NeuronCore, affine_range does not parallelize different loop iterations across multiple NeuronCores. However, different iterations could be parallelized/pipelined on different compute engines within a NeuronCore depending on the invoked instructions (engines) and data dependency in the loop body.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

 4# Example 1: No loop carried dependency
 5# Input/Output tensor shape: [128, 2048]

14  input_sb = nl.load(input[0:input.shape[0], offset:offset+512])

29  y_sbuf = nl.load(offset:offset+128, 0:y.shape[1]])
30
31  result_psum += nl.matmul(xT_sbuf, y_sbuf, transpose_x=True)

================================================================================

FUNCTION: sequential_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.sequential_range

Signature:
nki.language.sequential_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as sequential loop iterators in NKI. sequential_range should be used when there is a loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. See affine_range for an example of such associative reduction.

Notes:
Inside a NKI kernel, any use of Python range(...) will be replaced with sequential_range(...) by Neuron compiler.
Using sequential_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using sequential_range informs Neuron compiler to respect inter-loop dependency and perform much more conservative loop-level optimizations compared to affine_range.
Using affine_range instead of sequential_range in case of loop carried dependency incorrectly is considered unsafe and could lead to numerical errors.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
 2
 3#######################################################################
 4# Example 1: Loop carried dependency from tiling tensor_tensor_scan
 5# Both sbuf tensor input0 and input1 shapes: [128, 2048]

 7# Store the scan output to another [128, 2048] tensor
 8#######################################################################

10# Loop iterations communicate through this init tensor
11init = nl.zeros((128, 1), dtype=input0.dtype)
12
13# This loop will only produce correct results if the iterations are performed in order
14for i_input in nl.sequential_range(input0.shape[1] // 512):
15  offset = i_input * 512
16
17  # Depends on scan result from the previous loop iteration
18  result = nisa.tensor_tensor_scan(input0[:, offset:offset+512],
19                                   input1[:, offset:offset+512],
20                                   initial=init,
21                                   op0=nl.multiply, op1=nl.add)
22
23  nl.store(output[0:input0.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)
24
25  # Prepare initial result for scan in the next loop iteration
26  init[:, :] = result[:, 511]

================================================================================

FUNCTION: static_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.static_range

Signature:
nki.language.static_range(*args)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as loop iterators in NKI, resulting in a fully unrolled loop. Unlike affine_range or sequential_range, Neuron compiler will fully unroll the loop during NKI kernel tracing.

Notes:
Due to loop unrolling, compilation time may go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
On-chip memory (SBUF) usage may also go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
No loop-level optimizations will be performed in the compiler.
static_range should only be used as a fall-back option for debugging purposes when affine_range or sequential_range is giving functionally incorrect results or undesirable performance characteristics.

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:25:57] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 9:
*** The error message indicates that using `nl.arange` for generating indices in a 1D context is unsupported because NKI requires at least two dimensions for indexing. The core issue arises from the use of `nl.arange` in the loops for both dimensions of the input tensors, particularly when the input tensors are 1D or when the second dimension is effectively treated as 1. I will fix this by replacing the indexing methods for 1D tensors with simple slicing techniques to avoid using `nl.arange` for one-dimensional cases. Instead of relying on `nl.arange` to generate indices, I can directly use slicing to handle the 1D case correctly. ***

*** In this refactored code, I check the number of dimensions of the input tensors. If a tensor is 1D, I simply iterate over its range using `nl.arange(v1.shape[0])` and access its elements directly. In contrast, for 2D tensors, I maintain the nested loop structure to access each element by its row and column indices. This approach avoids the issue with 1D tensor indexing entirely while maintaining the necessary functionality for both 1D and 2D cases. ***

[2025-03-22 12:25:57] EXTRACTED REASONING:
The error message indicates that using `nl.arange` for generating indices in a 1D context is unsupported because NKI requires at least two dimensions for indexing. The core issue arises from the use of `nl.arange` in the loops for both dimensions of the input tensors, particularly when the input tensors are 1D or when the second dimension is effectively treated as 1. I will fix this by replacing the indexing methods for 1D tensors with simple slicing techniques to avoid using `nl.arange` for one-dimensional cases. Instead of relying on `nl.arange` to generate indices, I can directly use slicing to handle the 1D case correctly.

Instruction 1: Cannot update immutable parameter
Instruction 2: By default all parameters to the top level nki kernels are immutable, updating
immutable parameters in the kernel is not allowed.
Instruction 3: To fix this error, you could copy the parameter to a temp buffer and modify the buffer instead:

============================================================

ERROR: exceed-max-supported-dimension
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI API tensor parameter exceeds max supported number of dimensions.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on how many dimensions the tensor parameter can have:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 32 , 2 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: parameter 'x[64, 32, 2]' of 'transpose' exceed max supported number of dimensions of 2. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 64 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works if input `x` only have 2 dimensions (i.e. rank=2)

============================================================

ERROR: failed-to-infer-tile-from-local-tensor
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI requires inputs of all compute APIs to be valid tiles with the first dimension
being the partition dimension.
Instruction 2: To fix the problem you can use index tensorato generate a tile whose first dimension is the partition dimension
Code Example 1:
 # We mark the second dimension as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . add ( a , 32 ) # Error: Failed to infer tile from tensor 'a',
Code Example 2:
 # We mark the second dimension of tensor a as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . ndarray (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in range ( 4 ): # result of `a[i]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i ] = nl . add ( a [ i ], 32 ) # works # Or explicitly generate a tile with `nl.arange` ix = nl . arange ( 8 )[:, None ] iy = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] # result of `a[i, ix, iy]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i , ix , iy ] = nl . add ( a [ i , ix , iy ], 32 ) # also works

============================================================

ERROR: indirect-indices-free-dim
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic indexing for load/store only supports the indirect indexing
to be on the partition or block dimension. Refer to the code examples innl.loadandnl.store.
Instruction 2: Also, if you’re usingnl.mgridyou may get this error even though your indirect indexing
was on the partition dimension, usenl.arangeinstead.
Code Example 1:
nl.mgrid
Code Example 2:
nl.arange
Code Example 3:
 i_p , i_f = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 64 , 0 : 512 ] # this won't work for dynamic access i_p = nl . arange ( 64 )[:, None ] # this works for dynamic access i_f = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] data_tile = nl . load ( data_tensor [ idx_tile [ i_p , 0 ], i_f ])

============================================================

ERROR: local-variable-used-out-of-scope
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensors in NKI are not allowed to be used outside of their parent scope.
Instruction 2: Tensors in NKI have a stricter scope rules than Python. In NKI, control blocks
in if/else/for statements will introduce their own scope for tensors. A tensor
defined in if/else/for control blocks are not allowed to be used outside of the
scope.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you can rewrite the above code as:
Instruction 4: This stricter scope rules may also introduce unexpected error like the following:
Instruction 5: To fix the problem you can follow the suggestion from the warning
Code Example 1:

ERROR: num-partition-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: NKI requires the number of partitions of a tile to not exceed the architecture limitation of 128
Instruction 3: For example in Trainium:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 256 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Error: number of partitions 256 exceed architecture limitation of 128. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Works

============================================================

ERROR: num-partition-mismatch
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions mismatch.
Instruction 2: Most of the APIs in the nki.isa module require all operands to have the same number of partitions.
For example, the nki.isa.tensor_tensor() requires all operands to have the same number of partitions.
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y0 = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 1 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # Error: number of partitions (dimension 0 size of a tile) mismatch in parameters (data1[128, 512], data2[1, 512]) of 'tensor_tensor' y1 = y0 . broadcast_to ([ 128 , 512 ]) # Call `broadcast_to` to explicitly broadcast on the partition dimension z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # works because x and y1 has the same number of partitions

ERROR: size-of-dimension-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Size of dimension exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on dimension sizes of the parameter tensor:
Code Example 1:

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-access-out-of-bound
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor access out-of-bound.
Instruction 2: Out-of-bound access is considered illegal in NKI. When the indices are calculated
from nki indexing APIs, out-of-bound access results in a compile-time error.
When the indices are calculated dynamically at run-time, such as indirect
memory accesses, out-of-bound access results in run-time exceptions during
execution of the kernel.
Instruction 3: You could carefully check the corresponding indices and make necessary correction.
If the indices are correct and intentional, out-of-bound access can be avoided by
providing a proper mask:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . ndarray ([ 128 , 4000 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) for i in nl . affine_range (( 4000 + 512 - 1 ) // 512 ): tile = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 128 , 0 : 512 ] nl . store ( x [ tile . p , i * 512 + tile . x ], value = 0 ) # Error: Out-of-bound access for tensor `x` on dimension 1: index range [0, 4095] exceed dimension size of 4000
Code Example 2:
 x = nl . ndarray ([ 128 , 4000 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) for i in nl . affine_range (( 4000 + 512 - 1 ) // 512 ): tile = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 128 , 0 : 512 ] nl . store ( x [ tile . p , i * 512 + tile . x ], value = 0 , mask = i * 512 + tile . x < 4000 ) # Ok

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-output-not-written-to
==================================================
Instruction 1: A tensor was either passed as an output parameter to kernel but never written to, or
no output parameter was passed to the kernel at all. At least one output parameter
must be provided to kernels.
Instruction 2: If you did pass an output parameter to your kernel, and this still occurred, this means the tensor
was never written to. The most common cause for this is a dead-loop, such as when a range expression
evaluates to 0 and the loop performing the store operation is not actually being entered. But this can occur
in any situation in which a loop is never entered, regardless of flow-control construct (for, if, while, etc..)
Instruction 3: Consider doing the following:
Instruction 4: Evaluate your range expressions and conditionals to make sure they’re what you intended. If you were trying to perform
a computation on tiles smaller than your numerator (M in this case), use math.ceil() around your
range expression. e.g. nl.affine_range(math.ceil(M / N)). You will likely need to pass a mask to your
load and store operations as well to account for this.
Instruction 5: If the possible dead-loop is intentional, you need to issue a store that writes to the entire tensor
somewhere in the kernel outside of the dead loop. One good way to do this is to invokestore()on your output tensor with a default value.
Instruction 6: For example:
Code Example 1:
 def  incorrect ( tensor_in , tensor_out ): M = 128 N = M + 1 for i in nl . affine_range ( M // N ): # This is the cause of the error, as N > M, M // N will evaluate to 0 a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called. def  also_incorrect_in_the_same_way ( tensor_in , tensor_out , cnd ): # This will cause the error if the value of `cnd` is False while cnd : a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called.
Code Example 2:
 def  memset_output ( input , output , cnd ): # Initialize the output if we cannot guarantee the output are always written later nl . store ( output [ i_p , i_f ], value = 0 ) while cnd : # Ok even if the value of `cnd` is False a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a )

Instruction 3: nl.matmul() without setting transpose_x=True.
Instruction 4: User must use their own allocated identity matrix, and call nisa.nc_matmul() explicitly to perform
transpose on TensorEngine.

ERROR: unexpected-output-dependencies
==================================================
Instruction 1: Unexpected output dependencies.
Instruction 2: NKI assume kernel instances in the spmd grid and iteration between affine_range
can be executed in parallel require synchronization on the output. As a result,
each iteration of the loop will write to a different memory location.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you could either index the destination with the missing indices:
Instruction 4: Or if you want to write to the same memory location, you could usesequential_rangewhich allows writing to the same memory location:
Code Example 1:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . affine_range ( 4 ): a [ 0 ] = 0 # Unexpected output dependencies, different iterations of i loop write to `a[0]`
Code Example 2:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . affine_range ( 4 ): a [ i ] = 0 # Ok
Code Example 3:

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Store into a tensor on device memory (HBM) from on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.
value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# from data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
nl.store(out_tensor, data_tile)

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:

FUNCTION: prod
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.prod

Signature:
nki.language.prod(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Product of elements along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.prod))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
keepdims – If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

Returns:
a tile with the product of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: affine_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.affine_range

Signature:
nki.language.affine_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as parallel loop iterators in NKI. affine_range should be the default loop iterator choice, when there is no loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. A concrete example of associative reduction is multiple nl.matmul or nisa.nc_matmul calls accumulating into the same output buffer defined outside of this loop level (see code example #2 below).
When the above conditions are not met, we recommend using sequential_range instead.

Notes:
Using affine_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using affine_range also allows Neuron compiler to perform additional loop-level optimizations, such as loop vectorization in current release. The exact type of loop-level optimizations applied is subject to changes in future releases.
Since each kernel instance only runs on a single NeuronCore, affine_range does not parallelize different loop iterations across multiple NeuronCores. However, different iterations could be parallelized/pipelined on different compute engines within a NeuronCore depending on the invoked instructions (engines) and data dependency in the loop body.

FUNCTION: sequential_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.sequential_range

Signature:
nki.language.sequential_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as sequential loop iterators in NKI. sequential_range should be used when there is a loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. See affine_range for an example of such associative reduction.

Notes:
Inside a NKI kernel, any use of Python range(...) will be replaced with sequential_range(...) by Neuron compiler.
Using sequential_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using sequential_range informs Neuron compiler to respect inter-loop dependency and perform much more conservative loop-level optimizations compared to affine_range.
Using affine_range instead of sequential_range in case of loop carried dependency incorrectly is considered unsafe and could lead to numerical errors.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
 2
 3#######################################################################
 4# Example 1: Loop carried dependency from tiling tensor_tensor_scan
 5# Both sbuf tensor input0 and input1 shapes: [128, 2048]
 6# Perform a scan operation between the two inputs using a tile size of [128, 512]
 7# Store the scan output to another [128, 2048] tensor
 8#######################################################################
 9
10# Loop iterations communicate through this init tensor
11init = nl.zeros((128, 1), dtype=input0.dtype)
12
13# This loop will only produce correct results if the iterations are performed in order
14for i_input in nl.sequential_range(input0.shape[1] // 512):
15  offset = i_input * 512
16
17  # Depends on scan result from the previous loop iteration
18  result = nisa.tensor_tensor_scan(input0[:, offset:offset+512],
19                                   input1[:, offset:offset+512],
20                                   initial=init,
21                                   op0=nl.multiply, op1=nl.add)
22
23  nl.store(output[0:input0.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)
24
25  # Prepare initial result for scan in the next loop iteration
26  init[:, :] = result[:, 511]

================================================================================

FUNCTION: static_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.static_range

Signature:
nki.language.static_range(*args)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as loop iterators in NKI, resulting in a fully unrolled loop. Unlike affine_range or sequential_range, Neuron compiler will fully unroll the loop during NKI kernel tracing.

Notes:
Due to loop unrolling, compilation time may go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
On-chip memory (SBUF) usage may also go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
No loop-level optimizations will be performed in the compiler.
static_range should only be used as a fall-back option for debugging purposes when affine_range or sequential_range is giving functionally incorrect results or undesirable performance characteristics.

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:26:19] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 10:
*** The error message indicates that using `nl.arange` for generating indices in a 1D context is not supported. The NKI framework requires that tensor indices have at least two dimensions to properly match the underlying memory structures. This means that I cannot use `nl.arange` directly for a 1D input tensor. Instead, I will need to reshape the indices generated by `nl.arange` to ensure they have the required dimensionality. Additionally, handling of the output shape and storage must be adjusted to ensure compatibility with the NKI framework. ***

To fix the kernel, I will update the 1D case to reshape the indices and ensure that the loading and storing of tensors are done correctly. I will use the following approach:

1. For the 1D case, I will create a new axis for the index generated by `nl.arange` by reshaping it using `[:, None]`.
2. In the 2D case, I will keep the existing logic but ensure that the indices are consistent across different operations.
3. I will also ensure that I check for the shapes of input tensors to avoid runtime issues.

Here’s the revised kernel code:

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Store into a tensor on device memory (HBM) from on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.
value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
none

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# from data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
nl.store(out_tensor, data_tile)

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 

...
# store into out_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
# from data_tile[128, 512] 
i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
nl.store(out_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f], value=data_tile[i_p, i_f])

FUNCTION: prod
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.prod

Signature:
nki.language.prod(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Product of elements along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.prod))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
keepdims – If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

Returns:
a tile with the product of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: affine_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.affine_range

Signature:
nki.language.affine_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as parallel loop iterators in NKI. affine_range should be the default loop iterator choice, when there is no loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. A concrete example of associative reduction is multiple nl.matmul or nisa.nc_matmul calls accumulating into the same output buffer defined outside of this loop level (see code example #2 below).
When the above conditions are not met, we recommend using sequential_range instead.

Notes:
Using affine_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using affine_range also allows Neuron compiler to perform additional loop-level optimizations, such as loop vectorization in current release. The exact type of loop-level optimizations applied is subject to changes in future releases.
Since each kernel instance only runs on a single NeuronCore, affine_range does not parallelize different loop iterations across multiple NeuronCores. However, different iterations could be parallelized/pipelined on different compute engines within a NeuronCore depending on the invoked instructions (engines) and data dependency in the loop body.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
 2
 3#######################################################################
 4# Example 1: No loop carried dependency
 5# Input/Output tensor shape: [128, 2048]

 7# and store it into output tile
 8#######################################################################

10# Every loop instance works on an independent input/output tile.
11# No data dependency between loop instances.
12for i_input in nl.affine_range(input.shape[1] // 512):
13  offset = i_input * 512
14  input_sb = nl.load(input[0:input.shape[0], offset:offset+512])
15  result = nl.multiply(input_sb, input_sb)
16  nl.store(output[0:input.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)
17
18#######################################################################
19# Example 2: Matmul output buffer accumulation, a type of associative reduction

21# Load one tile ([128, 128]) from both xT and y at a time, matmul and
22# accumulate into the same output buffer
23#######################################################################
24
25result_psum = nl.zeros((128, 128), dtype=nl.float32, buffer=nl.psum)
26for i_K in nl.affine_range(xT.shape[0] // 128):
27  offset = i_K * 128
28  xT_sbuf = nl.load(offset:offset+128, 0:xT.shape[1]])
29  y_sbuf = nl.load(offset:offset+128, 0:y.shape[1]])
30
31  result_psum += nl.matmul(xT_sbuf, y_sbuf, transpose_x=True)

================================================================================

FUNCTION: sequential_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.sequential_range

Signature:
nki.language.sequential_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as sequential loop iterators in NKI. sequential_range should be used when there is a loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. See affine_range for an example of such associative reduction.

Notes:
Inside a NKI kernel, any use of Python range(...) will be replaced with sequential_range(...) by Neuron compiler.
Using sequential_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using sequential_range informs Neuron compiler to respect inter-loop dependency and perform much more conservative loop-level optimizations compared to affine_range.
Using affine_range instead of sequential_range in case of loop carried dependency incorrectly is considered unsafe and could lead to numerical errors.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
 2
 3#######################################################################
 4# Example 1: Loop carried dependency from tiling tensor_tensor_scan
 5# Both sbuf tensor input0 and input1 shapes: [128, 2048]
 6# Perform a scan operation between the two inputs using a tile size of [128, 512]
 7# Store the scan output to another [128, 2048] tensor
 8#######################################################################
 9
10# Loop iterations communicate through this init tensor
11init = nl.zeros((128, 1), dtype=input0.dtype)
12
13# This loop will only produce correct results if the iterations are performed in order
14for i_input in nl.sequential_range(input0.shape[1] // 512):
15  offset = i_input * 512
16
17  # Depends on scan result from the previous loop iteration
18  result = nisa.tensor_tensor_scan(input0[:, offset:offset+512],
19                                   input1[:, offset:offset+512],
20                                   initial=init,
21                                   op0=nl.multiply, op1=nl.add)
22
23  nl.store(output[0:input0.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)
24
25  # Prepare initial result for scan in the next loop iteration
26  init[:, :] = result[:, 511]

================================================================================

FUNCTION: static_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.static_range

Signature:
nki.language.static_range(*args)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as loop iterators in NKI, resulting in a fully unrolled loop. Unlike affine_range or sequential_range, Neuron compiler will fully unroll the loop during NKI kernel tracing.

Notes:
Due to loop unrolling, compilation time may go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
On-chip memory (SBUF) usage may also go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
No loop-level optimizations will be performed in the compiler.
static_range should only be used as a fall-back option for debugging purposes when affine_range or sequential_range is giving functionally incorrect results or undesirable performance characteristics.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: abs
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.abs

Signature:
nki.language.abs(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Absolute value of the input, element-wise.

Parameters:
x – a tile.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has absolute values of x.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: full
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.full

Signature:
nki.language.full(shape, fill_value, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with initial value.
((Similar to numpy.full))

name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:

================================================================================

FUNCTION: ones
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.ones

Signature:
nki.language.ones(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with ones.
((Similar to numpy.ones))

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros_like
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros_like

Signature:
nki.language.zeros_like(a, dtype=None, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of zeros with the same shape and type as a given tensor.
((Similar to numpy.zeros_like))

Parameters:
a – the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.

Here is detailed documentation about the specific errors encountered:
--------------------------------------------------
ERROR: 1d-arange-not-supported
==================================================
Instruction 1: Indexing a NKI tensor with 1D arange is not supported.
Instruction 2: NKI expects tile indices to have at least two dimensions to match the underlying
memory (SBUF or PSUM)
Instruction 3: You can workaround the problem by introducing new axes like the following code:
Instruction 4: Or using simple slicing:
Code Example 1:
 tmp = nl . zeros (( 128 , 1 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) i = nl . arange ( 64 ) c = nl . exp ( tmp [ i , 0 ]) # Error: indexing tensor `tmp` with 1d arange is not supported,
Code Example 2:
 tmp = nl . zeros (( 128 , 1 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) i = nl . arange ( 64 )[:, None ] c = nl . exp ( tmp [ i , 0 ])
Code Example 3:
 tmp = nl . zeros (( 128 , 1 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . exp ( tmp [ 0 : 64 , 0 ])

============================================================

ERROR: activation-bias-invalid-type
==================================================
Instruction 1: Bias parameter of activation or activation_reduce must be a vector of type float32, float16, or bfloat16.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], bias = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], bias = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = nl . bfloat16 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], bias = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . int8 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: activation-scale-invalid-type
==================================================
Instruction 1: Scale parameter of activation or activation_reduce must be a scalar or vector of type float32.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = 1.2 ) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float16 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: activation-scale-scalar-or-vector
==================================================
Instruction 1: Scale parameter of activation must be either a scalar value or a 1D vector spanning the partition dimension.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = 1.2 ) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 1 , 128 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # not supported nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 128 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: annotation-shape-mismatch
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor shape and the annotated shape mismatch
Instruction 2: NKI check the object shape based on python type annotation in thetarget: type = valuesyntax,
NKI will throw an error if the expected shape and the object shape mismatch.
Instruction 3: For example:
Code Example 1:
 import  neuronxcc.nki.typing  as  nt data : nt . tensor [ 128 , 512 ] = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) # Error: shape of `data[128, 128]` does not match the expected shape of [128, 512]

============================================================

ERROR: bias-tensor-must-be-specified-in-allocation
==================================================
Instruction 1: Bias tensor of an activation op must be specified in allocated NKI kernels.
Code Example 1:
 data = .... # assume data is of shape (128, 128) exp = nl . ndarray (( par_dim ( 128 ), 512 ), dtype = nl . bfloat16 , buffer = ncc . sbuf . mod_alloc ( base_addr = 0 )) exp [ ... ] = nisa . activation ( np . exp , data = data [ ... ]) # Error, bias argument must also be specified exp [ ... ] = nl . exp ( data = data [ ... ]) # Error, nl.exp maps to the the instruction as nisa.activation, must use nisa.activation and specify bias tensor in allocation kernels

============================================================

ERROR: cannot-assign-to-index
==================================================
Instruction 1: Anindextensor does not support item assignment. You may explicitly calliotato convert anindextensor to a normaltilebefore any assignments.
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] x [ 0 , 5 ] = 1024 # Error: 'index' tensor does not support item assignment y = nisa . iota ( x , dtype = nl . uint32 ) y [ 0 , 5 ] = 1024 # works

============================================================

ERROR: cannot-update-immutable-parameter
==================================================
Instruction 1: Cannot update immutable parameter
Instruction 2: By default all parameters to the top level nki kernels are immutable, updating
immutable parameters in the kernel is not allowed.
Instruction 3: To fix this error, you could copy the parameter to a temp buffer and modify the buffer instead:
Code Example 1:
 def  kernel ( in_tensor ): x = nl . load ( in_tensor ) y = x + 1 # Parameter `in_tensor` is immutable by default, cannot modify immutable parameter nl . store ( in_tensor , value = y ) # Error: Cannot update immutable parameter return in_tensor
Code Example 2:
 import  neuronxcc.nki.isa  as  nisa import  neuronxcc.nki.language  as  nl def  kernel ( in_tensor ): out_tensor = nl . ndarray ( in_tensor . shape , dtype = in_tensor . dtype , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) nisa . dma_copy ( dst = out_tensor , src = in_tensor ) x = nl . load ( out_tensor ) y = x + 1 nl . store ( out_tensor , value = y ) # ok return out_tensor

============================================================

ERROR: control-flow-condition-depending-on-arange
==================================================
Instruction 1: Control-flow depending onnl.arangeornl.mgridis not supported.
Instruction 2: In the above example, j depends on the value ofi1, which isnl.arange(512)[None, :].
NKI does not support usingnl.arangeornl.mgridin control-flow condition.
To workaround this error, you can use themaskparameter:
Code Example 1:
 for j0 in nl . affine_range ( 4096 ): i1 = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] j = j0 * 512 + i1 if j > 2048 : # Error: Control-flow depending on `nl.arange` or `nl.mgrid` is not supported y = nl . add ( x [ 0 , j ], x [ 0 , j - 2048 ])
Code Example 2:
 for j0 in nl . affine_range ( 4096 ): i1 = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] j = j0 * 512 + i1 y = nl . add ( x [ 0 , j ], x [ 0 , j - 2048 ], mask = j > 2048 )

============================================================

ERROR: dynamic-control-flow-not-supported
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is currently not supported by NKI.
Code Example 1:
 cnd = nl . load ( a ) # a have shape of [1, 1] if cnd : # Error: dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is not supported. nl . store ( b , 1 )

============================================================

ERROR: exceed-max-supported-dimension
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI API tensor parameter exceeds max supported number of dimensions.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on how many dimensions the tensor parameter can have:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 32 , 2 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: parameter 'x[64, 32, 2]' of 'transpose' exceed max supported number of dimensions of 2. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 64 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works if input `x` only have 2 dimensions (i.e. rank=2)

============================================================

ERROR: failed-to-infer-tile-from-local-tensor
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI requires inputs of all compute APIs to be valid tiles with the first dimension
being the partition dimension.
Instruction 2: To fix the problem you can use index tensorato generate a tile whose first dimension is the partition dimension
Code Example 1:
 # We mark the second dimension as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . add ( a , 32 ) # Error: Failed to infer tile from tensor 'a',
Code Example 2:
 # We mark the second dimension of tensor a as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . ndarray (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in range ( 4 ): # result of `a[i]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i ] = nl . add ( a [ i ], 32 ) # works # Or explicitly generate a tile with `nl.arange` ix = nl . arange ( 8 )[:, None ] iy = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] # result of `a[i, ix, iy]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i , ix , iy ] = nl . add ( a [ i , ix , iy ], 32 ) # also works

============================================================

ERROR: indirect-indices-free-dim
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic indexing for load/store only supports the indirect indexing
to be on the partition or block dimension. Refer to the code examples innl.loadandnl.store.
Instruction 2: Also, if you’re usingnl.mgridyou may get this error even though your indirect indexing
was on the partition dimension, usenl.arangeinstead.
Code Example 1:
nl.mgrid
Code Example 2:
nl.arange
Code Example 3:
 i_p , i_f = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 64 , 0 : 512 ] # this won't work for dynamic access i_p = nl . arange ( 64 )[:, None ] # this works for dynamic access i_f = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] data_tile = nl . load ( data_tensor [ idx_tile [ i_p , 0 ], i_f ])

============================================================

ERROR: local-variable-used-out-of-scope
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensors in NKI are not allowed to be used outside of their parent scope.
Instruction 2: Tensors in NKI have a stricter scope rules than Python. In NKI, control blocks
in if/else/for statements will introduce their own scope for tensors. A tensor
defined in if/else/for control blocks are not allowed to be used outside of the
scope.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you can rewrite the above code as:
Instruction 4: This stricter scope rules may also introduce unexpected error like the following:
Instruction 5: To fix the problem you can follow the suggestion from the warning
Code Example 1:
 for i in range ( 4 ): if i < 2 : tmp = nl . load ( a ) else : tmp = nl . load ( b ) nl . store ( c , tmp ) # Error: Local variable 'tmp' is referenced outside of its parent scope ...
Code Example 2:
 for i in range ( 4 ): tmp = nl . ndarray ( shape = a . shape , dtype = a . dtype ) if i < 2 : tmp [ ... ] = nl . load ( a ) else : tmp [ ... ] = nl . load ( b ) nl . store ( c , tmp )
Code Example 3:
 data = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) for i in nl . sequential_range ( 4 ): i_tile = nisa . iota ( i , dtype = nl . uint32 ) . broadcast_to ( data . shape ) data = data + i_tile # Warning: shadowing local tensor 'float32 data[128, 128]' with a new object, use 'data[...] =' if you want to update the existing object nl . store ( ptr , value = data ) # # Error: Local variable 'tmp' is referenced outside of its parent scope ...
Code Example 4:
 data = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) for i in nl . sequential_range ( 4 ): i_tile = nisa . iota ( i , dtype = nl . uint32 ) . broadcast_to ( data . shape ) data [ ... ] = data + i_tile nl . store ( ptr , value = data )

============================================================

ERROR: nested-kernel-with-spmd-grid

Instruction 1: Calling a NKI kernel with a SPMD grid from another NKI kernel is not supported.
Code Example 1:
 @nki . trace def  kernel0 ( ... ): ... @nki . trace def  kernel1 ( ... ): ... @nki_jit def  kernel_top (): kernel0 ( ... ) # works kernel1 [ 4 , 4 ]( ... ) # Error: Calling kernel with spmd grid (kernel1[4,4]) inside another kernel is not supported

============================================================

ERROR: nki-api-outside-of-nki-kernel
==================================================
Instruction 1: Calling NKI API outside of NKI kernels is not supported.
Instruction 2: Make sure the NKI kernel function decorated withnki.jit.

============================================================

ERROR: num-partition-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: NKI requires the number of partitions of a tile to not exceed the architecture limitation of 128
Instruction 3: For example in Trainium:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 256 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Error: number of partitions 256 exceed architecture limitation of 128. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Works

============================================================

ERROR: num-partition-mismatch
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions mismatch.
Instruction 2: Most of the APIs in the nki.isa module require all operands to have the same number of partitions.
For example, the nki.isa.tensor_tensor() requires all operands to have the same number of partitions.
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y0 = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 1 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # Error: number of partitions (dimension 0 size of a tile) mismatch in parameters (data1[128, 512], data2[1, 512]) of 'tensor_tensor' y1 = y0 . broadcast_to ([ 128 , 512 ]) # Call `broadcast_to` to explicitly broadcast on the partition dimension z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # works because x and y1 has the same number of partitions

============================================================

ERROR: shared-hbm-must-in-kernel-level
==================================================
Instruction 1: shared_hbm tensor can only be created in top level kernel scope
Instruction 2: Creating shared_hbm tensors inside a loop, under if condition
or inside another function called by the top-level nki kernel
is not supported.
Instruction 3: Consider hoist the creation of shared_hbm tensors to the top
level kernel scope.
Code Example 1:
 @nki . jit def  kernel ( ... ): a = nl . ndarray (( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) # works for i in range ( 8 ): b = nl . ndarray (( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) # Error: shared_hbm buffer can only be created top level kernel scope if nl . program_id ( 0 ) >= 1 : c = nl . ndarray (( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) # Error: shared_hbm buffer can only be created top level kernel scope # Call another function func ( ... ) def  func ( ... ): d = nl . ndarray (( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) # Error: shared_hbm buffer can only be created top level kernel scope

============================================================

ERROR: size-of-dimension-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Size of dimension exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on dimension sizes of the parameter tensor:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: size of dimension 1 in 'x[128, 512]' of 'transpose' exceed architecture limitation of 128. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 128 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works size of dimension 1 < 128

============================================================

ERROR: store-dst-shape-smaller-than-other-shape
==================================================
Instruction 1: Illegal shape in assignment destination.
Instruction 2: The destination of assignment must have the same or bigger shape than the source
of assignment. Assigning multiple values to the same element in the assignment
destination from a single NKI API is not supported
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = ( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y = nl . zeros ( shape = ( 128 , 1 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y [ ... ] = x # Error: Illegal assignment destination shape in 'a = b': shape [128, 1] of parameter 'a' is smaller than other parameter shapes b[128, 512]. x [ ... ] = y # ok, if we are broadcasting from source to the destination of the assignment

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-access-out-of-bound
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor access out-of-bound.
Instruction 2: Out-of-bound access is considered illegal in NKI. When the indices are calculated
from nki indexing APIs, out-of-bound access results in a compile-time error.
When the indices are calculated dynamically at run-time, such as indirect
memory accesses, out-of-bound access results in run-time exceptions during
execution of the kernel.
Instruction 3: You could carefully check the corresponding indices and make necessary correction.
If the indices are correct and intentional, out-of-bound access can be avoided by
providing a proper mask:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . ndarray ([ 128 , 4000 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) for i in nl . affine_range (( 4000 + 512 - 1 ) // 512 ): tile = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 128 , 0 : 512 ] nl . store ( x [ tile . p , i * 512 + tile . x ], value = 0 ) # Error: Out-of-bound access for tensor `x` on dimension 1: index range [0, 4095] exceed dimension size of 4000
Code Example 2:
 x = nl . ndarray ([ 128 , 4000 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) for i in nl . affine_range (( 4000 + 512 - 1 ) // 512 ): tile = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 128 , 0 : 512 ] nl . store ( x [ tile . p , i * 512 + tile . x ], value = 0 , mask = i * 512 + tile . x < 4000 ) # Ok

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-creation-on-scratchpad-with-init-value-not-allowed
==================================================
Instruction 1: Creating SBUF/PSUM tensor with init value is not supported in allocated NKI kernels.
Code Example 1:
 t = nl . full (( 3 , par_dim ( 128 ), 512 ), fill_value = 1.0 , buffer = ncc . sbuf . mod_alloc ( base_addr = 0 )) # t is allocated and has a init value # Error: Creating SBUF/PSUM tensor with init value is not supported in allocated NKI kernels.

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-output-not-written-to
==================================================
Instruction 1: A tensor was either passed as an output parameter to kernel but never written to, or
no output parameter was passed to the kernel at all. At least one output parameter
must be provided to kernels.
Instruction 2: If you did pass an output parameter to your kernel, and this still occurred, this means the tensor
was never written to. The most common cause for this is a dead-loop, such as when a range expression
evaluates to 0 and the loop performing the store operation is not actually being entered. But this can occur
in any situation in which a loop is never entered, regardless of flow-control construct (for, if, while, etc..)
Instruction 3: Consider doing the following:
Instruction 4: Evaluate your range expressions and conditionals to make sure they’re what you intended. If you were trying to perform
a computation on tiles smaller than your numerator (M in this case), use math.ceil() around your
range expression. e.g. nl.affine_range(math.ceil(M / N)). You will likely need to pass a mask to your
load and store operations as well to account for this.
Instruction 5: If the possible dead-loop is intentional, you need to issue a store that writes to the entire tensor
somewhere in the kernel outside of the dead loop. One good way to do this is to invokestore()on your output tensor with a default value.
Instruction 6: For example:
Code Example 1:
 def  incorrect ( tensor_in , tensor_out ): M = 128 N = M + 1 for i in nl . affine_range ( M // N ): # This is the cause of the error, as N > M, M // N will evaluate to 0 a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called. def  also_incorrect_in_the_same_way ( tensor_in , tensor_out , cnd ): # This will cause the error if the value of `cnd` is False while cnd : a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called.
Code Example 2:
 def  memset_output ( input , output , cnd ): # Initialize the output if we cannot guarantee the output are always written later nl . store ( output [ i_p , i_f ], value = 0 ) while cnd : # Ok even if the value of `cnd` is False a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a )

ERROR: transpose-on-tensor-engine-not-allowed-in-allocated-kernel
==================================================
Instruction 1: Unsupported transpose case in allocated NKI kernels:
Instruction 2: nisa.nc_transpose() with TensorEngine, or
Instruction 3: nl.matmul() without setting transpose_x=True.
Instruction 4: User must use their own allocated identity matrix, and call nisa.nc_matmul() explicitly to perform

ERROR: unexpected-output-dependencies
==================================================
Instruction 1: Unexpected output dependencies.
Instruction 2: NKI assume kernel instances in the spmd grid and iteration between affine_range
can be executed in parallel require synchronization on the output. As a result,
each iteration of the loop will write to a different memory location.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you could either index the destination with the missing indices:
Instruction 4: Or if you want to write to the same memory location, you could usesequential_rangewhich allows writing to the same memory location:
Code Example 1:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . affine_range ( 4 ): a [ 0 ] = 0 # Unexpected output dependencies, different iterations of i loop write to `a[0]`
Code Example 2:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . affine_range ( 4 ): a [ i ] = 0 # Ok
Code Example 3:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . sequential_range ( 4 ): a [ 0 ] = 0 # Also ok, we dont expect the sequential_range to execute in parallel

============================================================

ERROR: unsupported-memory
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI API parameters are in the wrong memory.
Instruction 2: NKI enforces API-specific requirements on which memory the parameters are allocated,
that is, HBM, SBUF or PSUM. NKI will throw this error when the operands of a
NKI API call are not placed in the correct memory.
Code Example 1:
 tmp = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 4 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) x = nl . load ( tmp ) # Error: Expected operand 'src' of 'load' to be in address space 'hbm', but got a tile in 'sbuf' instead. tmp = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 4 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) x = nl . exp ( tmp ) # Error: Expected operand 'x' of 'exp' to be in address space 'psum|sbuf', but got a tile in 'hbm' instead.

============================================================

ERROR: unsupported-mixing-basic-advanced-tensor-indexing
==================================================
Instruction 1: Mixing basic tensor indexing and advanced tensor indexing is not supported
Instruction 2: You could avoid the error by either use basic indexing or advanced indexing but not both:
Code Example 1:
 a = nl . zeros (( 4 , 4 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) i = nl . arange ( 4 )[:, None ] c = nl . exp ( a [ i , :]) # Error: Mixing basic tensor indexing and advanced tensor indexing is not supported.

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:

value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# from data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
nl.store(out_tensor, data_tile)

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.

FUNCTION: prod
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.prod

Signature:
nki.language.prod(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Product of elements along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.prod))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
keepdims – If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

Returns:
a tile with the product of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: affine_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.affine_range

Signature:
nki.language.affine_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as parallel loop iterators in NKI. affine_range should be the default loop iterator choice, when there is no loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. A concrete example of associative reduction is multiple nl.matmul or nisa.nc_matmul calls accumulating into the same output buffer defined outside of this loop level (see code example #2 below).
When the above conditions are not met, we recommend using sequential_range instead.

Notes:
Using affine_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using affine_range also allows Neuron compiler to perform additional loop-level optimizations, such as loop vectorization in current release. The exact type of loop-level optimizations applied is subject to changes in future releases.
Since each kernel instance only runs on a single NeuronCore, affine_range does not parallelize different loop iterations across multiple NeuronCores. However, different iterations could be parallelized/pipelined on different compute engines within a NeuronCore depending on the invoked instructions (engines) and data dependency in the loop body.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

 4# Example 1: No loop carried dependency
 5# Input/Output tensor shape: [128, 2048]

14  input_sb = nl.load(input[0:input.shape[0], offset:offset+512])

29  y_sbuf = nl.load(offset:offset+128, 0:y.shape[1]])
30
31  result_psum += nl.matmul(xT_sbuf, y_sbuf, transpose_x=True)

================================================================================

FUNCTION: sequential_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.sequential_range

Signature:
nki.language.sequential_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as sequential loop iterators in NKI. sequential_range should be used when there is a loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. See affine_range for an example of such associative reduction.

Notes:
Inside a NKI kernel, any use of Python range(...) will be replaced with sequential_range(...) by Neuron compiler.
Using sequential_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using sequential_range informs Neuron compiler to respect inter-loop dependency and perform much more conservative loop-level optimizations compared to affine_range.
Using affine_range instead of sequential_range in case of loop carried dependency incorrectly is considered unsafe and could lead to numerical errors.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
 2
 3#######################################################################
 4# Example 1: Loop carried dependency from tiling tensor_tensor_scan
 5# Both sbuf tensor input0 and input1 shapes: [128, 2048]

 7# Store the scan output to another [128, 2048] tensor
 8#######################################################################

10# Loop iterations communicate through this init tensor
11init = nl.zeros((128, 1), dtype=input0.dtype)
12
13# This loop will only produce correct results if the iterations are performed in order
14for i_input in nl.sequential_range(input0.shape[1] // 512):
15  offset = i_input * 512
16
17  # Depends on scan result from the previous loop iteration
18  result = nisa.tensor_tensor_scan(input0[:, offset:offset+512],
19                                   input1[:, offset:offset+512],
20                                   initial=init,
21                                   op0=nl.multiply, op1=nl.add)
22
23  nl.store(output[0:input0.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)
24
25  # Prepare initial result for scan in the next loop iteration
26  init[:, :] = result[:, 511]

================================================================================

FUNCTION: static_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.static_range

Signature:
nki.language.static_range(*args)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as loop iterators in NKI, resulting in a fully unrolled loop. Unlike affine_range or sequential_range, Neuron compiler will fully unroll the loop during NKI kernel tracing.

Notes:
Due to loop unrolling, compilation time may go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
On-chip memory (SBUF) usage may also go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
No loop-level optimizations will be performed in the compiler.
static_range should only be used as a fall-back option for debugging purposes when affine_range or sequential_range is giving functionally incorrect results or undesirable performance characteristics.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: abs
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.abs

Signature:
nki.language.abs(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Absolute value of the input, element-wise.

Parameters:
x – a tile.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has absolute values of x.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: full
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.full

Signature:
nki.language.full(shape, fill_value, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:28:51] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 12:
*** The error message indicates that the shape element must be integers, and it highlights the line where I create the output tensor (`result = nl.zeros(shape=[v1.shape, 1], dtype=v1.dtype)`). The issue stems from the fact that I have used `v1.shape` directly, which is a tuple containing the shape dimensions. Instead, I need to unpack this tuple so that each dimension is treated as an integer. In addition, NKI tensors must have at least two dimensions, so I can restructure the output tensor creation to correctly account for that requirement. ***

*** Additionally, the error messages hint that indexing the tensors with 1D arange is not supported. To handle this appropriately, I can modify how I index into the input tensors for both 1D and 2D cases. I will use slicing and ensure that I create tiles with compatible dimensions to meet NKI's requirements. ***

*** In this revised code, I corrected the output tensor shape creation to ensure it's a valid tensor for NKI's requirements. I also modified the load and store operations to use slicing, which ensures that the dimensionality remains compatible with the NKI requirements for tensor operations. This should resolve the errors encountered when executing the kernel. ***

[2025-03-22 12:28:51] EXTRACTED REASONING:
The error message indicates that the shape element must be integers, and it highlights the line where I create the output tensor (`result = nl.zeros(shape=[v1.shape, 1], dtype=v1.dtype)`). The issue stems from the fact that I have used `v1.shape` directly, which is a tuple containing the shape dimensions. Instead, I need to unpack this tuple so that each dimension is treated as an integer. In addition, NKI tensors must have at least two dimensions, so I can restructure the output tensor creation to correctly account for that requirement.
Additionally, the error messages hint that indexing the tensors with 1D arange is not supported. To handle this appropriately, I can modify how I index into the input tensors for both 1D and 2D cases. I will use slicing and ensure that I create tiles with compatible dimensions to meet NKI's requirements.

==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor shape and the annotated shape mismatch
Instruction 2: NKI check the object shape based on python type annotation in thetarget: type = valuesyntax,
NKI will throw an error if the expected shape and the object shape mismatch.
Instruction 3: For example:

============================================================

ERROR: cannot-update-immutable-parameter
==================================================
Instruction 1: Cannot update immutable parameter
Instruction 2: By default all parameters to the top level nki kernels are immutable, updating
immutable parameters in the kernel is not allowed.
Instruction 3: To fix this error, you could copy the parameter to a temp buffer and modify the buffer instead:
Code Example 1:
 def  kernel ( in_tensor ): x = nl . load ( in_tensor ) y = x + 1 # Parameter `in_tensor` is immutable by default, cannot modify immutable parameter nl . store ( in_tensor , value = y ) # Error: Cannot update immutable parameter return in_tensor

============================================================

ERROR: dynamic-control-flow-not-supported
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is currently not supported by NKI.
Code Example 1:
 cnd = nl . load ( a ) # a have shape of [1, 1] if cnd : # Error: dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is not supported. nl . store ( b , 1 )

============================================================

ERROR: exceed-max-supported-dimension
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI API tensor parameter exceeds max supported number of dimensions.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on how many dimensions the tensor parameter can have:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 32 , 2 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: parameter 'x[64, 32, 2]' of 'transpose' exceed max supported number of dimensions of 2. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 64 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works if input `x` only have 2 dimensions (i.e. rank=2)

============================================================

ERROR: failed-to-infer-tile-from-local-tensor
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI requires inputs of all compute APIs to be valid tiles with the first dimension
being the partition dimension.
Instruction 2: To fix the problem you can use index tensorato generate a tile whose first dimension is the partition dimension
Code Example 1:
 # We mark the second dimension as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . add ( a , 32 ) # Error: Failed to infer tile from tensor 'a',
Code Example 2:
 # We mark the second dimension of tensor a as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . ndarray (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in range ( 4 ): # result of `a[i]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i ] = nl . add ( a [ i ], 32 ) # works # Or explicitly generate a tile with `nl.arange` ix = nl . arange ( 8 )[:, None ] iy = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] # result of `a[i, ix, iy]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i , ix , iy ] = nl . add ( a [ i , ix , iy ], 32 ) # also works

============================================================

ERROR: indirect-indices-free-dim
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic indexing for load/store only supports the indirect indexing
to be on the partition or block dimension. Refer to the code examples innl.loadandnl.store.
Instruction 2: Also, if you’re usingnl.mgridyou may get this error even though your indirect indexing
was on the partition dimension, usenl.arangeinstead.
Code Example 1:
nl.mgrid
Code Example 2:
nl.arange
Code Example 3:
 i_p , i_f = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 64 , 0 : 512 ] # this won't work for dynamic access i_p = nl . arange ( 64 )[:, None ] # this works for dynamic access i_f = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] data_tile = nl . load ( data_tensor [ idx_tile [ i_p , 0 ], i_f ])

============================================================

ERROR: local-variable-used-out-of-scope
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensors in NKI are not allowed to be used outside of their parent scope.
Instruction 2: Tensors in NKI have a stricter scope rules than Python. In NKI, control blocks
in if/else/for statements will introduce their own scope for tensors. A tensor
defined in if/else/for control blocks are not allowed to be used outside of the
scope.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you can rewrite the above code as:
Instruction 4: This stricter scope rules may also introduce unexpected error like the following:
Instruction 5: To fix the problem you can follow the suggestion from the warning
Code Example 1:
 for i in range ( 4 ): if i < 2 : tmp = nl . load ( a ) else : tmp = nl . load ( b ) nl . store ( c , tmp ) # Error: Local variable 'tmp' is referenced outside of its parent scope ...
Code Example 2:

ERROR: tensor-access-out-of-bound
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor access out-of-bound.
Instruction 2: Out-of-bound access is considered illegal in NKI. When the indices are calculated
from nki indexing APIs, out-of-bound access results in a compile-time error.
When the indices are calculated dynamically at run-time, such as indirect
memory accesses, out-of-bound access results in run-time exceptions during
execution of the kernel.
Instruction 3: You could carefully check the corresponding indices and make necessary correction.
If the indices are correct and intentional, out-of-bound access can be avoided by
providing a proper mask:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . ndarray ([ 128 , 4000 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . hbm ) for i in nl . affine_range (( 4000 + 512 - 1 ) // 512 ): tile = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 128 , 0 : 512 ] nl . store ( x [ tile . p , i * 512 + tile . x ], value = 0 ) # Error: Out-of-bound access for tensor `x` on dimension 1: index range [0, 4095] exceed dimension size of 4000
Code Example 2:

ERROR: tensor-output-not-written-to
==================================================
Instruction 1: A tensor was either passed as an output parameter to kernel but never written to, or
no output parameter was passed to the kernel at all. At least one output parameter
must be provided to kernels.
Instruction 2: If you did pass an output parameter to your kernel, and this still occurred, this means the tensor
was never written to. The most common cause for this is a dead-loop, such as when a range expression
evaluates to 0 and the loop performing the store operation is not actually being entered. But this can occur
in any situation in which a loop is never entered, regardless of flow-control construct (for, if, while, etc..)
Instruction 3: Consider doing the following:
Instruction 4: Evaluate your range expressions and conditionals to make sure they’re what you intended. If you were trying to perform
a computation on tiles smaller than your numerator (M in this case), use math.ceil() around your
range expression. e.g. nl.affine_range(math.ceil(M / N)). You will likely need to pass a mask to your
load and store operations as well to account for this.
Instruction 5: If the possible dead-loop is intentional, you need to issue a store that writes to the entire tensor
somewhere in the kernel outside of the dead loop. One good way to do this is to invokestore()on your output tensor with a default value.
Instruction 6: For example:
Code Example 1:
 def  incorrect ( tensor_in , tensor_out ): M = 128 N = M + 1 for i in nl . affine_range ( M // N ): # This is the cause of the error, as N > M, M // N will evaluate to 0 a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called. def  also_incorrect_in_the_same_way ( tensor_in , tensor_out , cnd ): # This will cause the error if the value of `cnd` is False while cnd : a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called.
Code Example 2:
 def  memset_output ( input , output , cnd ): # Initialize the output if we cannot guarantee the output are always written later nl . store ( output [ i_p , i_f ], value = 0 ) while cnd : # Ok even if the value of `cnd` is False a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a )

Instruction 4: User must use their own allocated identity matrix, and call nisa.nc_matmul() explicitly to perform
transpose on TensorEngine.

ERROR: unexpected-output-dependencies
==================================================
Instruction 1: Unexpected output dependencies.
Instruction 2: NKI assume kernel instances in the spmd grid and iteration between affine_range
can be executed in parallel require synchronization on the output. As a result,
each iteration of the loop will write to a different memory location.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you could either index the destination with the missing indices:
Instruction 4: Or if you want to write to the same memory location, you could usesequential_rangewhich allows writing to the same memory location:
Code Example 1:

Code Example 2:

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Store into a tensor on device memory (HBM) from on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
dst – HBM tensor to store the data into.
value – An SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# from data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
nl.store(out_tensor, data_tile)

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:

FUNCTION: prod
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.prod

Signature:
nki.language.prod(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Product of elements along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.prod))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
keepdims – If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

Returns:
a tile with the product of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: affine_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.affine_range

Signature:
nki.language.affine_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as parallel loop iterators in NKI. affine_range should be the default loop iterator choice, when there is no loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. A concrete example of associative reduction is multiple nl.matmul or nisa.nc_matmul calls accumulating into the same output buffer defined outside of this loop level (see code example #2 below).
When the above conditions are not met, we recommend using sequential_range instead.

Notes:
Using affine_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using affine_range also allows Neuron compiler to perform additional loop-level optimizations, such as loop vectorization in current release. The exact type of loop-level optimizations applied is subject to changes in future releases.
Since each kernel instance only runs on a single NeuronCore, affine_range does not parallelize different loop iterations across multiple NeuronCores. However, different iterations could be parallelized/pipelined on different compute engines within a NeuronCore depending on the invoked instructions (engines) and data dependency in the loop body.

Example:

FUNCTION: sequential_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.sequential_range

Signature:
nki.language.sequential_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as sequential loop iterators in NKI. sequential_range should be used when there is a loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. See affine_range for an example of such associative reduction.

Notes:
Inside a NKI kernel, any use of Python range(...) will be replaced with sequential_range(...) by Neuron compiler.
Using sequential_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using sequential_range informs Neuron compiler to respect inter-loop dependency and perform much more conservative loop-level optimizations compared to affine_range.
Using affine_range instead of sequential_range in case of loop carried dependency incorrectly is considered unsafe and could lead to numerical errors.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

14for i_input in nl.sequential_range(input0.shape[1] // 512):
15  offset = i_input * 512

17  # Depends on scan result from the previous loop iteration
18  result = nisa.tensor_tensor_scan(input0[:, offset:offset+512],

26  init[:, :] = result[:, 511]

================================================================================

FUNCTION: static_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.static_range

Signature:
nki.language.static_range(*args)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as loop iterators in NKI, resulting in a fully unrolled loop. Unlike affine_range or sequential_range, Neuron compiler will fully unroll the loop during NKI kernel tracing.

Notes:
Due to loop unrolling, compilation time may go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
On-chip memory (SBUF) usage may also go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
No loop-level optimizations will be performed in the compiler.
static_range should only be used as a fall-back option for debugging purposes when affine_range or sequential_range is giving functionally incorrect results or undesirable performance characteristics.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: abs
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.abs

Signature:
nki.language.abs(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Absolute value of the input, element-wise.

Parameters:
x – a tile.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has absolute values of x.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: full
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.full

Signature:
nki.language.full(shape, fill_value, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with initial value.
((Similar to numpy.full))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
fill_value – the initial value of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).

FUNCTION: ones
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.ones

name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros_like
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros_like

Signature:
nki.language.zeros_like(a, dtype=None, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of zeros with the same shape and type as a given tensor.
((Similar to numpy.zeros_like))

Parameters:
a – the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:29:22] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 13:
*** The error indicates that the use of `nl.arange` in a 1D context is not supported, as the NKI requires at least a 2D indexing for tensors when using `arange`. The error message specifically states that "Only support multi-dimensional subscript to arange!", which means I need to modify how I generate indices for the loops, especially in the kernel's 1D and 2D cases. ***

To resolve this issue, I will replace the usage of `nl.arange` with a compatible method for generating indices that ensures at least 2 dimensions are used. I can achieve this by reshaping the output of `nl.arange` to have an additional dimension when indexing. 

In the 1D case, I will change the way I create the loop variable to ensure it is treated as a 2D tensor. In the 2D case, I'll use the same approach for indexing the array but keep the logic the same.

ERROR: tensor-access-out-of-bound
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor access out-of-bound.
Instruction 2: Out-of-bound access is considered illegal in NKI. When the indices are calculated
from nki indexing APIs, out-of-bound access results in a compile-time error.
When the indices are calculated dynamically at run-time, such as indirect
memory accesses, out-of-bound access results in run-time exceptions during
execution of the kernel.
Instruction 3: You could carefully check the corresponding indices and make necessary correction.
If the indices are correct and intentional, out-of-bound access can be avoided by
providing a proper mask:
Code Example 1:

ERROR: tensor-output-not-written-to
==================================================
Instruction 1: A tensor was either passed as an output parameter to kernel but never written to, or
no output parameter was passed to the kernel at all. At least one output parameter
must be provided to kernels.
Instruction 2: If you did pass an output parameter to your kernel, and this still occurred, this means the tensor
was never written to. The most common cause for this is a dead-loop, such as when a range expression
evaluates to 0 and the loop performing the store operation is not actually being entered. But this can occur
in any situation in which a loop is never entered, regardless of flow-control construct (for, if, while, etc..)
Instruction 3: Consider doing the following:
Instruction 4: Evaluate your range expressions and conditionals to make sure they’re what you intended. If you were trying to perform
a computation on tiles smaller than your numerator (M in this case), use math.ceil() around your
range expression. e.g. nl.affine_range(math.ceil(M / N)). You will likely need to pass a mask to your
load and store operations as well to account for this.
Instruction 5: If the possible dead-loop is intentional, you need to issue a store that writes to the entire tensor
somewhere in the kernel outside of the dead loop. One good way to do this is to invokestore()on your output tensor with a default value.
Instruction 6: For example:
Code Example 1:
 def  incorrect ( tensor_in , tensor_out ): M = 128 N = M + 1 for i in nl . affine_range ( M // N ): # This is the cause of the error, as N > M, M // N will evaluate to 0 a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called. def  also_incorrect_in_the_same_way ( tensor_in , tensor_out , cnd ): # This will cause the error if the value of `cnd` is False while cnd : a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called.
Code Example 2:
 def  memset_output ( input , output , cnd ): # Initialize the output if we cannot guarantee the output are always written later nl . store ( output [ i_p , i_f ], value = 0 ) while cnd : # Ok even if the value of `cnd` is False a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a )

Instruction 1: Unexpected output dependencies.
Instruction 2: NKI assume kernel instances in the spmd grid and iteration between affine_range

Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you could either index the destination with the missing indices:
Instruction 4: Or if you want to write to the same memory location, you could usesequential_rangewhich allows writing to the same memory location:

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:

See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM

FUNCTION: prod
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.prod

Signature:
nki.language.prod(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Product of elements along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.prod))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
keepdims – If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

Returns:
a tile with the product of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: affine_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.affine_range

Signature:
nki.language.affine_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as parallel loop iterators in NKI. affine_range should be the default loop iterator choice, when there is no loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. A concrete example of associative reduction is multiple nl.matmul or nisa.nc_matmul calls accumulating into the same output buffer defined outside of this loop level (see code example #2 below).
When the above conditions are not met, we recommend using sequential_range instead.

Notes:
Using affine_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using affine_range also allows Neuron compiler to perform additional loop-level optimizations, such as loop vectorization in current release. The exact type of loop-level optimizations applied is subject to changes in future releases.
Since each kernel instance only runs on a single NeuronCore, affine_range does not parallelize different loop iterations across multiple NeuronCores. However, different iterations could be parallelized/pipelined on different compute engines within a NeuronCore depending on the invoked instructions (engines) and data dependency in the loop body.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
 2
 3#######################################################################
 4# Example 1: No loop carried dependency
 5# Input/Output tensor shape: [128, 2048]

 7# and store it into output tile
 8#######################################################################

10# Every loop instance works on an independent input/output tile.
11# No data dependency between loop instances.
12for i_input in nl.affine_range(input.shape[1] // 512):
13  offset = i_input * 512
14  input_sb = nl.load(input[0:input.shape[0], offset:offset+512])
15  result = nl.multiply(input_sb, input_sb)
16  nl.store(output[0:input.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)

27  offset = i_K * 128
28  xT_sbuf = nl.load(offset:offset+128, 0:xT.shape[1]])
29  y_sbuf = nl.load(offset:offset+128, 0:y.shape[1]])
30
31  result_psum += nl.matmul(xT_sbuf, y_sbuf, transpose_x=True)

================================================================================

FUNCTION: sequential_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.sequential_range

Signature:
nki.language.sequential_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as sequential loop iterators in NKI. sequential_range should be used when there is a loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. See affine_range for an example of such associative reduction.

Notes:
Inside a NKI kernel, any use of Python range(...) will be replaced with sequential_range(...) by Neuron compiler.
Using sequential_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using sequential_range informs Neuron compiler to respect inter-loop dependency and perform much more conservative loop-level optimizations compared to affine_range.
Using affine_range instead of sequential_range in case of loop carried dependency incorrectly is considered unsafe and could lead to numerical errors.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
 2
 3#######################################################################
 4# Example 1: Loop carried dependency from tiling tensor_tensor_scan
 5# Both sbuf tensor input0 and input1 shapes: [128, 2048]

 7# Store the scan output to another [128, 2048] tensor
 8#######################################################################

10# Loop iterations communicate through this init tensor
11init = nl.zeros((128, 1), dtype=input0.dtype)
12
13# This loop will only produce correct results if the iterations are performed in order
14for i_input in nl.sequential_range(input0.shape[1] // 512):
15  offset = i_input * 512
16
17  # Depends on scan result from the previous loop iteration
18  result = nisa.tensor_tensor_scan(input0[:, offset:offset+512],
19                                   input1[:, offset:offset+512],
20                                   initial=init,
21                                   op0=nl.multiply, op1=nl.add)
22
23  nl.store(output[0:input0.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)
24
25  # Prepare initial result for scan in the next loop iteration
26  init[:, :] = result[:, 511]

================================================================================

FUNCTION: static_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.static_range

Signature:
nki.language.static_range(*args)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as loop iterators in NKI, resulting in a fully unrolled loop. Unlike affine_range or sequential_range, Neuron compiler will fully unroll the loop during NKI kernel tracing.

Notes:
Due to loop unrolling, compilation time may go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
On-chip memory (SBUF) usage may also go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
No loop-level optimizations will be performed in the compiler.
static_range should only be used as a fall-back option for debugging purposes when affine_range or sequential_range is giving functionally incorrect results or undesirable performance characteristics.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: abs
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.abs

Signature:
nki.language.abs(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:

nki.language.full

Signature:

((Similar to numpy.ones))

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros_like

Description:
Create a new tensor of zeros with the same shape and type as a given tensor.
((Similar to numpy.zeros_like))

ERROR: activation-bias-invalid-type
==================================================
Instruction 1: Bias parameter of activation or activation_reduce must be a vector of type float32, float16, or bfloat16.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], bias = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], bias = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = nl . bfloat16 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], bias = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . int8 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: activation-scale-invalid-type
==================================================
Instruction 1: Scale parameter of activation or activation_reduce must be a scalar or vector of type float32.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = 1.2 ) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float16 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: activation-scale-scalar-or-vector
==================================================
Instruction 1: Scale parameter of activation must be either a scalar value or a 1D vector spanning the partition dimension.
Code Example 1:
 nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = 1.2 ) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 1 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # ok nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 1 , 128 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # not supported nisa . activation ( op = nl . exp , data = data [ ... ], scale = nisa . memset (( 128 , 128 ), 1.2 , dtype = np . float32 )) # not supported

============================================================

ERROR: annotation-shape-mismatch
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor shape and the annotated shape mismatch
Instruction 2: NKI check the object shape based on python type annotation in thetarget: type = valuesyntax,
NKI will throw an error if the expected shape and the object shape mismatch.
Instruction 3: For example:
Code Example 1:
 import  neuronxcc.nki.typing  as  nt data : nt . tensor [ 128 , 512 ] = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) # Error: shape of `data[128, 128]` does not match the expected shape of [128, 512]

============================================================

ERROR: bias-tensor-must-be-specified-in-allocation

============================================================

ERROR: cannot-assign-to-index
==================================================
Instruction 1: Anindextensor does not support item assignment. You may explicitly calliotato convert anindextensor to a normaltilebefore any assignments.
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] x [ 0 , 5 ] = 1024 # Error: 'index' tensor does not support item assignment y = nisa . iota ( x , dtype = nl . uint32 ) y [ 0 , 5 ] = 1024 # works

============================================================

ERROR: cannot-update-immutable-parameter
==================================================
Instruction 1: Cannot update immutable parameter
Instruction 2: By default all parameters to the top level nki kernels are immutable, updating
immutable parameters in the kernel is not allowed.
Instruction 3: To fix this error, you could copy the parameter to a temp buffer and modify the buffer instead:
Code Example 1:
 def  kernel ( in_tensor ): x = nl . load ( in_tensor ) y = x + 1 # Parameter `in_tensor` is immutable by default, cannot modify immutable parameter nl . store ( in_tensor , value = y ) # Error: Cannot update immutable parameter return in_tensor
Code Example 2:
 import  neuronxcc.nki.isa  as  nisa import  neuronxcc.nki.language  as  nl def  kernel ( in_tensor ): out_tensor = nl . ndarray ( in_tensor . shape , dtype = in_tensor . dtype , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) nisa . dma_copy ( dst = out_tensor , src = in_tensor ) x = nl . load ( out_tensor ) y = x + 1 nl . store ( out_tensor , value = y ) # ok return out_tensor

============================================================

ERROR: control-flow-condition-depending-on-arange
==================================================
Instruction 1: Control-flow depending onnl.arangeornl.mgridis not supported.
Instruction 2: In the above example, j depends on the value ofi1, which isnl.arange(512)[None, :].
NKI does not support usingnl.arangeornl.mgridin control-flow condition.
To workaround this error, you can use themaskparameter:
Code Example 1:
 for j0 in nl . affine_range ( 4096 ): i1 = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] j = j0 * 512 + i1 if j > 2048 : # Error: Control-flow depending on `nl.arange` or `nl.mgrid` is not supported y = nl . add ( x [ 0 , j ], x [ 0 , j - 2048 ])
Code Example 2:
 for j0 in nl . affine_range ( 4096 ): i1 = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] j = j0 * 512 + i1 y = nl . add ( x [ 0 , j ], x [ 0 , j - 2048 ], mask = j > 2048 )

============================================================

ERROR: dynamic-control-flow-not-supported
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is currently not supported by NKI.
Code Example 1:
 cnd = nl . load ( a ) # a have shape of [1, 1] if cnd : # Error: dynamic control-flow depending on tensor value is not supported. nl . store ( b , 1 )

============================================================

ERROR: exceed-max-supported-dimension
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI API tensor parameter exceeds max supported number of dimensions.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on how many dimensions the tensor parameter can have:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 32 , 2 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: parameter 'x[64, 32, 2]' of 'transpose' exceed max supported number of dimensions of 2. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 64 , 64 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works if input `x` only have 2 dimensions (i.e. rank=2)

============================================================

ERROR: failed-to-infer-tile-from-local-tensor
==================================================
Instruction 1: NKI requires inputs of all compute APIs to be valid tiles with the first dimension
being the partition dimension.
Instruction 2: To fix the problem you can use index tensorato generate a tile whose first dimension is the partition dimension
Code Example 1:
 # We mark the second dimension as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . add ( a , 32 ) # Error: Failed to infer tile from tensor 'a',
Code Example 2:
 # We mark the second dimension of tensor a as the partition dimension a = nl . zeros (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) c = nl . ndarray (( 4 , nl . par_dim ( 8 ), 8 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in range ( 4 ): # result of `a[i]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i ] = nl . add ( a [ i ], 32 ) # works # Or explicitly generate a tile with `nl.arange` ix = nl . arange ( 8 )[:, None ] iy = nl . arange ( 8 )[ None , :] # result of `a[i, ix, iy]` is a tile with shape (8, 8) and the first dimension is the partition dimension c [ i , ix , iy ] = nl . add ( a [ i , ix , iy ], 32 ) # also works

============================================================

ERROR: indirect-indices-free-dim
==================================================
Instruction 1: Dynamic indexing for load/store only supports the indirect indexing
to be on the partition or block dimension. Refer to the code examples innl.loadandnl.store.
Instruction 2: Also, if you’re usingnl.mgridyou may get this error even though your indirect indexing
was on the partition dimension, usenl.arangeinstead.
Code Example 1:
nl.mgrid
Code Example 2:
nl.arange
Code Example 3:
 i_p , i_f = nl . mgrid [ 0 : 64 , 0 : 512 ] # this won't work for dynamic access i_p = nl . arange ( 64 )[:, None ] # this works for dynamic access i_f = nl . arange ( 512 )[ None , :] data_tile = nl . load ( data_tensor [ idx_tile [ i_p , 0 ], i_f ])

============================================================

ERROR: local-variable-used-out-of-scope
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensors in NKI are not allowed to be used outside of their parent scope.
Instruction 2: Tensors in NKI have a stricter scope rules than Python. In NKI, control blocks
in if/else/for statements will introduce their own scope for tensors. A tensor
defined in if/else/for control blocks are not allowed to be used outside of the
scope.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you can rewrite the above code as:
Instruction 4: This stricter scope rules may also introduce unexpected error like the following:
Instruction 5: To fix the problem you can follow the suggestion from the warning
Code Example 1:
 for i in range ( 4 ): if i < 2 : tmp = nl . load ( a ) else : tmp = nl . load ( b ) nl . store ( c , tmp ) # Error: Local variable 'tmp' is referenced outside of its parent scope ...
Code Example 2:
 for i in range ( 4 ): tmp = nl . ndarray ( shape = a . shape , dtype = a . dtype ) if i < 2 : tmp [ ... ] = nl . load ( a ) else : tmp [ ... ] = nl . load ( b ) nl . store ( c , tmp )
Code Example 3:
 data = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) for i in nl . sequential_range ( 4 ): i_tile = nisa . iota ( i , dtype = nl . uint32 ) . broadcast_to ( data . shape ) data = data + i_tile # Warning: shadowing local tensor 'float32 data[128, 128]' with a new object, use 'data[...] =' if you want to update the existing object nl . store ( ptr , value = data ) # # Error: Local variable 'tmp' is referenced outside of its parent scope ...
Code Example 4:
 data = nl . zeros (( par_dim ( 128 ), 128 ), dtype = np . float32 ) for i in nl . sequential_range ( 4 ): i_tile = nisa . iota ( i , dtype = nl . uint32 ) . broadcast_to ( data . shape ) data [ ... ] = data + i_tile nl . store ( ptr , value = data )

============================================================

ERROR: nested-kernel-with-spmd-grid
==================================================
Instruction 1: Calling a NKI kernel with a SPMD grid from another NKI kernel is not supported.
Code Example 1:
 @nki . trace def  kernel0 ( ... ): ... @nki . trace def  kernel1 ( ... ): ... @nki_jit def  kernel_top (): kernel0 ( ... ) # works kernel1 [ 4 , 4 ]( ... ) # Error: Calling kernel with spmd grid (kernel1[4,4]) inside another kernel is not supported

============================================================

ERROR: nki-api-outside-of-nki-kernel
==================================================
Instruction 1: Calling NKI API outside of NKI kernels is not supported.
Instruction 2: Make sure the NKI kernel function decorated withnki.jit.

============================================================

ERROR: num-partition-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: NKI requires the number of partitions of a tile to not exceed the architecture limitation of 128
Instruction 3: For example in Trainium:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 256 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Error: number of partitions 256 exceed architecture limitation of 128. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 1024 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) # Works

============================================================

ERROR: num-partition-mismatch
==================================================
Instruction 1: Number of partitions mismatch.
Instruction 2: Most of the APIs in the nki.isa module require all operands to have the same number of partitions.
For example, the nki.isa.tensor_tensor() requires all operands to have the same number of partitions.
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y0 = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 1 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # Error: number of partitions (dimension 0 size of a tile) mismatch in parameters (data1[128, 512], data2[1, 512]) of 'tensor_tensor' y1 = y0 . broadcast_to ([ 128 , 512 ]) # Call `broadcast_to` to explicitly broadcast on the partition dimension z = nisa . tensor_tensor ( x , y0 , op = nl . add ) # works because x and y1 has the same number of partitions

============================================================

ERROR: shared-hbm-must-in-kernel-level
==================================================
Instruction 1: shared_hbm tensor can only be created in top level kernel scope
Instruction 2: Creating shared_hbm tensors inside a loop, under if condition
or inside another function called by the top-level nki kernel
is not supported.
Instruction 3: Consider hoist the creation of shared_hbm tensors to the top
level kernel scope.
Code Example 1:
 @nki . jit def  kernel ( ... ): a = nl . ndarray (( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) # works for i in range ( 8 ): b = nl . ndarray (( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) # Error: shared_hbm buffer can only be created top level kernel scope if nl . program_id ( 0 ) >= 1 : c = nl . ndarray (( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) # Error: shared_hbm buffer can only be created top level kernel scope # Call another function func ( ... ) def  func ( ... ): d = nl . ndarray (( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . shared_hbm ) # Error: shared_hbm buffer can only be created top level kernel scope

============================================================

ERROR: size-of-dimension-exceed-arch-limit
==================================================
Instruction 1: Size of dimension exceeds architecture limitation.
Instruction 2: Certain NKI APIs have restrictions on dimension sizes of the parameter tensor:
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 512 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Error: size of dimension 1 in 'x[128, 512]' of 'transpose' exceed architecture limitation of 128. x = nl . zeros ( shape = [ 128 , 128 ], dtype = np . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) b = nl . transpose ( x ) # Works size of dimension 1 < 128

============================================================

ERROR: store-dst-shape-smaller-than-other-shape
==================================================
Instruction 1: Illegal shape in assignment destination.
Instruction 2: The destination of assignment must have the same or bigger shape than the source
of assignment. Assigning multiple values to the same element in the assignment
destination from a single NKI API is not supported
Code Example 1:
 x = nl . zeros ( shape = ( 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y = nl . zeros ( shape = ( 128 , 1 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) y [ ... ] = x # Error: Illegal assignment destination shape in 'a = b': shape [128, 1] of parameter 'a' is smaller than other parameter shapes b[128, 512]. x [ ... ] = y # ok, if we are broadcasting from source to the destination of the assignment

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-access-out-of-bound
==================================================
Instruction 1: Tensor access out-of-bound.
Instruction 2: Out-of-bound access is considered illegal in NKI. When the indices are calculated
from nki indexing APIs, out-of-bound access results in a compile-time error.
When the indices are calculated dynamically at run-time, such as indirect
memory accesses, out-of-bound access results in run-time exceptions during
execution of the kernel.
Instruction 3: You could carefully check the corresponding indices and make necessary correction.
If the indices are correct and intentional, out-of-bound access can be avoided by
providing a proper mask:
Code Example 1:

============================================================

ERROR: tensor-output-not-written-to
==================================================
Instruction 1: A tensor was either passed as an output parameter to kernel but never written to, or
no output parameter was passed to the kernel at all. At least one output parameter
must be provided to kernels.
Instruction 2: If you did pass an output parameter to your kernel, and this still occurred, this means the tensor
was never written to. The most common cause for this is a dead-loop, such as when a range expression
evaluates to 0 and the loop performing the store operation is not actually being entered. But this can occur
in any situation in which a loop is never entered, regardless of flow-control construct (for, if, while, etc..)
Instruction 3: Consider doing the following:
Instruction 4: Evaluate your range expressions and conditionals to make sure they’re what you intended. If you were trying to perform
a computation on tiles smaller than your numerator (M in this case), use math.ceil() around your
range expression. e.g. nl.affine_range(math.ceil(M / N)). You will likely need to pass a mask to your
load and store operations as well to account for this.
Instruction 5: If the possible dead-loop is intentional, you need to issue a store that writes to the entire tensor
somewhere in the kernel outside of the dead loop. One good way to do this is to invokestore()on your output tensor with a default value.
Instruction 6: For example:
Code Example 1:
 def  incorrect ( tensor_in , tensor_out ): M = 128 N = M + 1 for i in nl . affine_range ( M // N ): # This is the cause of the error, as N > M, M // N will evaluate to 0 a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called. def  also_incorrect_in_the_same_way ( tensor_in , tensor_out , cnd ): # This will cause the error if the value of `cnd` is False while cnd : a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a ) # This store will never be called.
Code Example 2:
 def  memset_output ( input , output , cnd ): # Initialize the output if we cannot guarantee the output are always written later nl . store ( output [ i_p , i_f ], value = 0 ) while cnd : # Ok even if the value of `cnd` is False a = nl . load ( tensor_in ) nl . store ( tensor_out , value = a )

ERROR: unexpected-output-dependencies
==================================================
Instruction 1: Unexpected output dependencies.
Instruction 2: NKI assume kernel instances in the spmd grid and iteration between affine_range
can be executed in parallel require synchronization on the output. As a result,
each iteration of the loop will write to a different memory location.
Instruction 3: To fix the problem, you could either index the destination with the missing indices:
Instruction 4: Or if you want to write to the same memory location, you could usesequential_rangewhich allows writing to the same memory location:
Code Example 1:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . affine_range ( 4 ): a [ 0 ] = 0 # Unexpected output dependencies, different iterations of i loop write to `a[0]`
Code Example 2:
 a = nl . ndarray (( 4 , 128 , 512 ), dtype = nl . float32 , buffer = nl . sbuf ) for i in nl . affine_range ( 4 ): a [ i ] = 0 # Ok
Code Example 3:

FUNCTION: add
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.add

Signature:
nki.language.add(x, y, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Add the inputs, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.add))

Parameters:
x – a tile or a scalar value.
y – a tile or a scalar value. x.shape and y.shape must be broadcastable to a common shape, that will become the shape of the output.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tiles, or whichever input type has the highest precision (see NKI Type Promotion for more information);
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has x + y, element-wise.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
# add a and b element-wise and store in c[128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = 2.2
# add constant b to each element in a
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
# broadcast on free dimension -- [128, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on partition dimension -- [1, 512] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:1])
# broadcast on both dimensions -- [1, 1] is broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

a = nl.load(a_tensor[0:128, 0:1])
b = nl.load(b_tensor[0:1, 0:512])
# broadcast on each dimensions -- [128, 1] and [1, 512] are broadcasted to [128, 512]
c = nl.add(a, b)
nl.store(c_tensor[0:128, 0:512], c)

Note:
Broadcasting in the partition dimension is generally more expensive than broadcasting in free dimension. It is recommended to align your data to perform free dimension broadcast whenever possible.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: zeros
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.zeros

Signature:
nki.language.zeros(shape, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with zeros.
((Similar to numpy.zeros))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: arange
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.arange

Signature:
nki.language.arange(*args)

Description:
Return contiguous values within a given interval, used for indexing a tensor to define a tile.
((Similar to numpy.arange))
arange can be called as:
arange(stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [0, stop) (the interval including zero, excluding stop).
arange(start, stop): Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (the interval including start, excluding stop).

================================================================================

FUNCTION: load
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.load

Signature:
nki.language.load(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).
See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

# load from in_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# copy into data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
data_tile = nl.load(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
Partition dimension has to be the first dimension in the index tuple of a tile. Therefore, data may need to be split into multiple batches to load/store, for example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

for i_b in nl.affine_range(4):
  data_tile = nl.zeros((128, 512), dtype=in_tensor.dtype) 
  # load from in_tensor[4, 128, 512] one batch at a time
  # copy into data_tile[128, 512]
  i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
  data_tile[i_p, i_f] = nl.load(in_tensor[i_b, i_p, i_f])
  ...

FUNCTION: store
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.store

Signature:
nki.language.store(dst, value, *, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:

See Memory hierarchy for detailed information.

Parameters:

import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

...
# store into out_tensor[P, F] that is on HBM
# from data_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
nl.store(out_tensor, data_tile)

Note:

FUNCTION: prod
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.prod

Signature:
nki.language.prod(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Product of elements along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.prod))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
keepdims – If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

Returns:
a tile with the product of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: affine_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.affine_range

Signature:
nki.language.affine_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as parallel loop iterators in NKI. affine_range should be the default loop iterator choice, when there is no loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. A concrete example of associative reduction is multiple nl.matmul or nisa.nc_matmul calls accumulating into the same output buffer defined outside of this loop level (see code example #2 below).
When the above conditions are not met, we recommend using sequential_range instead.

Notes:
Using affine_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using affine_range also allows Neuron compiler to perform additional loop-level optimizations, such as loop vectorization in current release. The exact type of loop-level optimizations applied is subject to changes in future releases.
Since each kernel instance only runs on a single NeuronCore, affine_range does not parallelize different loop iterations across multiple NeuronCores. However, different iterations could be parallelized/pipelined on different compute engines within a NeuronCore depending on the invoked instructions (engines) and data dependency in the loop body.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

29  y_sbuf = nl.load(offset:offset+128, 0:y.shape[1]])
30
31  result_psum += nl.matmul(xT_sbuf, y_sbuf, transpose_x=True)

================================================================================

FUNCTION: sequential_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.sequential_range

Signature:
nki.language.sequential_range(*args, **kwargs)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as sequential loop iterators in NKI. sequential_range should be used when there is a loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are not considered loop carried dependencies in this context. See affine_range for an example of such associative reduction.

Notes:
Inside a NKI kernel, any use of Python range(...) will be replaced with sequential_range(...) by Neuron compiler.
Using sequential_range prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend, which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator static_range.
Using sequential_range informs Neuron compiler to respect inter-loop dependency and perform much more conservative loop-level optimizations compared to affine_range.
Using affine_range instead of sequential_range in case of loop carried dependency incorrectly is considered unsafe and could lead to numerical errors.

Example:
 1import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl

 4# Example 1: Loop carried dependency from tiling tensor_tensor_scan
 5# Both sbuf tensor input0 and input1 shapes: [128, 2048]

10# Loop iterations communicate through this init tensor
11init = nl.zeros((128, 1), dtype=input0.dtype)
12
13# This loop will only produce correct results if the iterations are performed in order
14for i_input in nl.sequential_range(input0.shape[1] // 512):
15  offset = i_input * 512
16
17  # Depends on scan result from the previous loop iteration
18  result = nisa.tensor_tensor_scan(input0[:, offset:offset+512],
19                                   input1[:, offset:offset+512],

21                                   op0=nl.multiply, op1=nl.add)
22
23  nl.store(output[0:input0.shape[0], offset:offset+512], result)
24
25  # Prepare initial result for scan in the next loop iteration
26  init[:, :] = result[:, 511]

================================================================================

FUNCTION: static_range
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.static_range

Signature:
nki.language.static_range(*args)

Description:
Create a sequence of numbers for use as loop iterators in NKI, resulting in a fully unrolled loop. Unlike affine_range or sequential_range, Neuron compiler will fully unroll the loop during NKI kernel tracing.

Notes:
Due to loop unrolling, compilation time may go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
On-chip memory (SBUF) usage may also go up significantly compared to affine_range or sequential_range.
No loop-level optimizations will be performed in the compiler.
static_range should only be used as a fall-back option for debugging purposes when affine_range or sequential_range is giving functionally incorrect results or undesirable performance characteristics.

================================================================================


FUNCTION: abs
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.abs

Signature:
nki.language.abs(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Absolute value of the input, element-wise.

Parameters:
x – a tile.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has absolute values of x.

================================================================================

FUNCTION: full
--------------------------------------------------
nki.language.full

Signature:
nki.language.full(shape, fill_value, dtype, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of given shape and dtype on the specified buffer, filled with initial value.
((Similar to numpy.full))

Parameters:
shape – the shape of the tensor.
fill_value – the initial value of the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
name – the name of the tensor.

Returns:
a new tensor allocated on the buffer.

Try to fix it. Clearly explain your line of reasoning as well as what you think the error is, and how you plan to fix it. Your output should include the entire new block of kernel code, NOT just the invidual fix. I want to be able to run the code inside the ``` ```Clearly put your initial reasoning inside triple stars like this *** example: i am making this change because i love unicorns ***. I want all your initial reasoning inside of these triple stars, not just the summary at the end.

[2025-03-22 12:31:01] LLM RESPONSE FOR ITERATION 15:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the usage of `nl.arange` in 1D contexts, which is not supported in the NKI framework. Specifically, it states that "Insufficient rank!" arises when attempting to index a tensor using a 1D arange. The `nl.arange` function should be used in a way that results in a 2D array (or higher), as the NKI expects at least two dimensions for indexing operations.

In the original kernel, I have attempted to reshape the index produced by `nl.arange` with `[:, None]`, which is not valid in this context. Instead, I should directly use `nl.arange` to create the necessary indexing without that reshaping. Additionally, when creating the output tensor, I should ensure that it adheres to the correct dimensional requirements.

To fix this, I will:
1. Remove the `[:, None]` reshape for `nl.arange`.
2. Use `nl.arange` directly as indices in the `load` and `store` calls.
3. Use `nl.zeros` to create the output tensor in a way that correctly matches the expected dimensions for the NKI.

Here's the revised kernel code:

```python
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
from neuronxcc import nki

@nki.jit
def vector_add_kernel(v1, v2):
    """
    Vector addition kernel that performs element-wise addition of two input tensors.

    v1: Input tensor (first vector)
    v2: Input tensor (second vector)
    
    Returns:
    result: Output tensor containing the sum of v1 and v2
    """
    # Validate that the input vectors have the same shape
    if v1.shape != v2.shape:
        raise ValueError("Input vectors must have the same shape")
    
    # Ensure both tensors have a valid shape for NKI
    if len(v1.shape) < 1 or len(v2.shape) < 1:
        raise ValueError("Input vectors must have at least one dimension")

    # Create an output tensor of the same shape with zeros
    result = nl.zeros(v1.shape, dtype=v1.dtype)  # Correctly create a tensor without an extra dimension

    # Check if the input tensors are 1D or 2D and handle accordingly
    if len(v1.shape) == 1:  # 1D case
        for i in nl.arange(v1.shape[0]):  # No reshaping here, keep it as 1D
            a = nl.load(v1[i])  # Load the element from the first tensor
            b = nl.load(v2[i])  # Load the element from the second tensor
            c = nl.add(a, b)  # Perform element-wise addition
            nl.store(result[i], c)  # Store the result

    else:  # 2D case

            for j in nl.arange(v1.shape[1]):  # No reshaping for 1D arange
                # Load the elements from the input tensors
                a = nl.load(v1[i, j])  # Use slicing to maintain dimensionality
                b = nl.load(v2[i, j])  # Use slicing to maintain dimensionality
                
                # Perform element-wise addition
                c = nl.add(a, b)
                
                # Store the result back into the output tensor
                nl.store(result[i, j], c)  # Store properly

    return result
