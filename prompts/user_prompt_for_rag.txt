Generate a custom kernel for vector addition a using AWS Neural Kernel Interface (NKI). The kernel should:
- Use the proper NKI API integration.
- Follow best practices for compilation.
- Be well-structured, modular, and maintainable.
- Only write the kernel. Nothing else.
- Once again. ONLY write the kernel. Nothing else.

Here is a python implementation for it:

def vector_add(v1, v2):
    """
    Adds two vectors element-wise using an explicit loop.
    :param v1: List of numbers (first vector)
    :param v2: List of numbers (second vector)
    :return: List representing the sum of the two vectors
    """
    if len(v1) != len(v2):
        raise ValueError("Vectors must be of the same length")
    
    result = []
    for i in range(len(v1)):
        result.append(v1[i] + v2[i])
    
    return result

Don't use libnrt.so.1

Make sure to return the output. Make sure to import nki: from neuronxcc import nki

ignore everything after this
Here is the kernel you just wrote:



Here is the error message it got:




Can you try to fix it! Thanks!
